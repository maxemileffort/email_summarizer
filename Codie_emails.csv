Happy Trends Tuesday!

Today we‚Äôve got:

* 1 trend alert

* 1 piece of operator wisdom

* 1 startup you should know about

Before getting into it, we‚Äôve got one small ask. Please take this 1-minute survey <https://link.trends.co/click/30970911.57191/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZm9ybXMvZC9lLzFGQUlwUUxTZFh4U0VDRFZqQzdodnBfai1QWGM4Z2FYV1pPVy1CSXFxNW1MZW1SWDNYRm1vamRRL3ZpZXdmb3JtP3VzcD1zZl9saW5r/6115604f8717d5561f1db827Ccbe83d2e> to help us make this newsletter better.

Alright, let‚Äôs jump in.

‚Ää
üö® TREND ALERT

Fun fact ‚Äì boomers own nearly half the private businesses in the US (~2.3m companies).

Why does this matter to you?

An estimated ~10k boomers hit retirement age every day.

<https://link.trends.co/click/30970911.57191/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVuZHMuY28vc2lnbmFsL3RoZS1ib29tLWluLWJvb21lci1idXNpbmVzcy1kZWFscy8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT10cmVuZHNfdGxkciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj0wM18yOF8yMw/6115604f8717d5561f1db827C04ff551a>

Many don‚Äôt have anyone to pass the family business on to, and close their doors.

You can help them preserve their legacies via‚Ä¶

* Business-For-Sale Platforms: BizBuySell gets ~2.6m visits/mo and more niche options like Acquire are growing quickly. Many boomers don‚Äôt know how to capitalize on them. Build a consulting service to help them out, or launch a new platform that caters specifically to this audience.

* Family Legacy Summit: Straight from My First Million, start an event designed to teach boomer entrepreneurs how to pass on their businesses. Monetize by offering upsell services like accounting or by selling leads to private equity (which can be valued at $25k-$100k+ depending on the size of the company).

* Buy ‚ÄòEm Yourself: Acquire great businesses, install an operator, and continue running and growing them. Several Trends members have taken this path including Codie Sanchez and Matthew Rescott (see below).

üß† OPERATOR WISDOM

Trends member Matthew Rescott recently bought a business doing ~$600k in revenue (~100k profit), and he put just $20k down.

How'd he do it?

First, he used local Facebook groups to find an acquisition target. Here‚Äôs the post <https://link.trends.co/click/30970911.57191/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVuZHMuY28vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjIvMDkvTWF0dGhldy1SZXNjb3R0LTEuanBlZw/6115604f8717d5561f1db827C507565c4> that landed him 30 leads, including the business he ended up buying.

After running due diligence, Matthew set his eyes on a deal with a final price of $240k. To make it happen, he set out to find financing.

With the seller in a hurry, SBA wasn‚Äôt an option. No shortcuts or hacks here: Matthew kept reaching out to lenders until eventually (after ~30 lenders) he was able to get it done. The final deal was structured like this:

* $20k down

* $120k bank loan

* $100k seller note

Matthew‚Äôs takeaway? ‚ÄúThe rules in lending are a lot more gray than you would expect.‚Äù He says he just had to meet the lenders in person and prove his business proficiency to get them on board.

üî• STARTUPS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

Systemic health disparities in the US are far-reaching and impact a wide range of medical fields, including maternal health, obesity, and LGBTQ+ care.

Startups have sprung up across specialties to develop solutions for patients previously overlooked, underserved, or misunderstood.

Happy Trends Tuesday!

Today we‚Äôve got:

* 1 startup you should know about

Let's get to it.

‚Ää
üö® TREND ALERT

Cannabis is good for more than teenage jokes and Elon Musk memes.

The hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) market is forecast to reach $6.5B by 2025; a 32.5% annual growth rate from 2019:

<https://link.trends.co/click/31265932.55178/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVuZHMuY28vc2lnbmFsL3RoZS1oZW1wLXJldm9sdXRpb24tcm9sbHMtaW4vP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9dHJlbmRzX3RsZHImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249MDRfMjVfMjM/6115604f8717d5561f1db827C607f9459>

Just to be clear, we‚Äôre not talking about getting high. Hemp is a non-psychoactive form of the cannabis plant that contains CBD.

Here are some opportunities in this market:

* Smokeables: One of the fastest growing (and most lucrative) segments, the US market for smokable hemp is forecast to reach $300m - $400m in 2025. One Trendster recently shared that his pre-roll biz did $17m+ in 2021.

* Oils and Edibles: Interest in edible CBD products is soaring <https://link.trends.co/click/31265932.55178/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVuZHMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS90cmVuZHMvZXhwbG9yZT9kYXRlPTIwMTUtMDEtMDElMjAyMDIzLTA0LTIwJmdlbz1VUyZxPUNCRCUyMGVkaWJsZQ/6115604f8717d5561f1db827C61687ba2>. But one study found that nearly 70% of online products are mislabeled. There are opportunities to focus on high-quality products, or to concentrate on specific niches (i.e. sleep or gut health).

* The Pet Niche: Pet-friendly cannabinoids are also on the rise, for everything from arthritis to aging issues. This niche is particularly appealing because the pet industry is notoriously recession-proof <https://link.trends.co/click/31265932.55178/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVuZHMuY28vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1yZWNlc3Npb24tcHJvb2YtaW5kdXN0cnktb2YtcGV0LWhlYWx0aC8/6115604f8717d5561f1db827C5b390f04>.

üß† OPERATOR WISDOM

Building any company is hard, but it‚Äôs especially challenging for those in the so-called vice industries like cannabis.

We spoke with Trendster Codie Sanchez about her experience investing in CANN, a THC-infused cannabis drink, and got two lessons on how cannabis brands bring their products to market:

* Alternative Marketing: Though legal, CANN is barred from using ad platforms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. To overcome this, they got the attention of celebrities and influencers like Rebel Wilson, Casey Neistat, and Gwyneth Paltrow who promoted the brand to their audiences.

* Show Don‚Äôt Tell: As a low-cost product, retailers were hesitant to stock CANN. So the team mastered the art of the pop-up event to prove to dispensaries that their product is a customer magnet.

‚Ää
üî• STARTUP YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

If your furry friend felt left out on 4/20, fret not.

Catnip, a type of plant that‚Äôs part of the mint family, gets cats high through a chemical called nepetalactone.

And petcare brand Meowijuana <https://link.trends.co/click/31265932.55178/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVvd2lqdWFuYS5jb20v/6115604f8717d5561f1db827C58d31f05> is looking to help take the edge off with a line of catnip products packaged like weed.

The company sells everything a cat owner needs, from treats and toys to accessories, and even has a line for dogs ‚Äî you guessed it, Doggijuana ‚Äî too.

We‚Äôre back again, and this time we have a framework you can steal
for any side hustle or business you have. We‚Äôre here so you can
copy my homework. R&D = rip off and duplicate.

Today in 10 minutes or less, you‚Äôll learn:
------------------------------------------

* Some vids you can‚Äôt take your eyes off (it‚Äôs not just me,
right?)
* How power washing is a proxy for any service biz side hustle
* How to get started, differentiate, market, and power up your

)‚Äã

THE POWER OF BORING
-------------------

‚Äã

-------------------------------------------
Ok, I‚Äôve done every side hustle imaginable.
-------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve also turned them into 6 then 7 then 8-figure businesses.
Which is how I now have a portfolio of businesses that does more
than $50M a year in revenue. But alas, it was not always that
way.

‚Äã
So, let‚Äôs start with power washing as a side hustle.

------------------
Why power washing?
------------------

Because this idea for our business is going to cost you $0 to
start. Yes, $0 to start. And also because‚Ä¶

I Love Watching Porn
--------------------

Ok easy, this is a special type‚Ä¶ maybe you too have watched hours
of r/powerwashingporn (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/3ohphkhqpq5o07tr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL3Bvd2Vyd2FzaGluZ3Bvcm4v
) on Reddit.

Get your head out of the gutters, Contrarians. I said Power
Washing porn. Jeez.

I don‚Äôt know what part of the brain tingles when it sees before
and after photos of pressure-washed houses, but I think it‚Äôs the
same part that tingles when I sense a good money-making
opportunity. Right now, just FYI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm tingling.

‚Äã

-------------------------------
Power washing as a side hustle:
-------------------------------

(PS, this works for any type of service biz)

* $0 Cost - You can pre-sell washes with $0 in materials.
* Low Failure Risk - Your only cost is your labor. If you decide
to scale up this business, you have no inventory, no big
expenses, and no shipping expectations. The risk of bankruptcy is
tiny.
* No shipping or supply chain nonsense - I hate e-commerce
companies 9 times out of 10. The costs are too high, shipping is
expensive, order values are high, and it‚Äôs largely
over-saturated.
* B2B Option - There is demand in both commercial and residential
spaces. A house is easy to close the deal, but a commercial
company may pay you $5,000 every month on contract. UP FRONT. If
you can keep a business free from gum on their sidewalk, or with
clean windows, or clear sidewalk lines, they‚Äôll pay.
* Beginner friendly - You don‚Äôt need to be an expert or licensed.
Because we aren‚Äôt. ;)
* Finding clients is easy - You live next to them and most of
them need this service.
* It‚Äôd be fun to sell - Wait until you see my ideas for how.

How much would it cost to start?
--------------------------------

Let‚Äôs start with the equipment. You can buy a high-end
gas-powered pressure washer on Amazon for under $350.

‚Äã
Or you could go high-end and get a fancy $35,000 truck setup (I
wouldn‚Äôt advise that up front), or you can go Unconventional
Acquisitions (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/48hvheh0x0d5v6ux/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3Vyc2VzLnVuY29udmVudGlvbmFsYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zLmNvbS9jb3Vyc2VzL2J1eWluZy1hLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzP3JlZj1hYzlhZjU=
) style and buy an entire pressure washing business that
cashflows $220k a year‚Ä¶

‚Äã
If you want to go the biz buying route‚Ä¶ ya‚Äôll already know where
to go to learn biz buying‚Ä¶ here (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/reh8hohq6ql24nb2/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3Vyc2VzLnVuY29udmVudGlvbmFsYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zLmNvbS9jb3Vyc2VzL2J1eWluZy1hLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNz
).

But let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre going to start this biz because you want
lower risk OR you‚Äôre going to make your kid, Tommy, pay for the
college education that‚Äôs really just expensive propaganda by his
damn self.

Ok, starter version
-------------------

Where to begin? Well, you‚Äôve already bought your fancy little
machine for $350. Next, you‚Äôll want to trick out your pressure
washer with some additional accessories, and that can run you
about $40.

‚Äã
Then we‚Äôll need some pressure washer cleaner. Most cleaners run
about $20 and will cover 6500 square feet.

Breakdown:

$350 Power Washer

$40 Accessories

$80 Ladder

$40 Hose

$20 Cleaning solution

= Total of $530

So, for about $500 in start-up costs, you have what you need to
make money.

How much money can be made?
---------------------------

You can charge around $350-500 to pressure wash a driveway. With
only two driveways, you have paid for your pressure washing
business.

The best part? Rarely does someone just need their driveway
pressure washed. To pressure wash a 2000 sq foot home, you can
charge $800-$1000. If you add in their front or back porch?
That‚Äôs another $400. So, a single home can bring in $1500 ‚Äì
$2000.

Great, with one home you‚Äôre at breakeven+ and with two you are in
the money.

But let‚Äôs say you are like me, and you don‚Äôt want to do the
actual labor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs outsource it. The average technician in Texas makes $44,276
a year. That‚Äôs working 40-hour weeks. Let‚Äôs say you go premium at
$50k a year + $300 a month in benefits (which would be unheard
of).

That means:

Let‚Äôs say we could get one customer a day each month. With the
marketing we‚Äôre going to show you later, that should be
absolutely doable. That‚Äôs $547,500 a year. Now imagine you add
another contractor or two, each only doing one house a day.
That‚Äôs $1,642,000 a year.

‚Äã
But how much money do we actually take home?

‚Äã
For every new contractor you add, you get another $413k profit.
So with you, two contractors, and a VA for scheduling and
customer service, you would be bringing in $1.23M in PROFIT in
one year. You add five and you‚Äôre at $2.06M. Now you‚Äôll have some
increased costs for sure, but you can very safely keep around a
30% margin business.

LET'S SCALE
-----------

---------------------------------------------
How would I differentiate this $2M+ business?
---------------------------------------------

#1 Show-Me-Don‚Äôt-Tell-Me marketing
----------------------------------

I‚Äôd have a blast with the marketing. I‚Äôd have posters with this
on them.

‚Äã
I‚Äôd do non-stop social media highlighting this:

‚Äã
And the marketing would change with every season:

‚Äã

#2 Never sell just one thing‚Ä¶ bundle, bundle baby.
--------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôd be a one-stop shop, so I‚Äôd add:

* roof cleaning
* pool cleaning
* wood/deck fence restoration
* gutter cleaning
* window cleaning
* exterior painting

That‚Äôs probably another $500-$1M in additional revenue a year.

#3 Re-occurring revenue - sell it once, charge it continuously.
---------------------------------------------------------------

* 3 options on my upsell: Big package, medium package, small
package. Highlight medium in the middle.

Everyone works too hard. They sell a pressure washing job once.
They don‚Äôt try to get them on subscription. YOU are not going to
be that. I‚Äôd sell annual or biannual power washing just like
this. (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/08hwh9hmlm6ovntl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXRyY29udHJhY3RvcnMuY29tL3BsYW5z
) Then I‚Äôd schedule all the neighbors on the same dates. No one
ever needs a last-minute re-occurring power wash.

#4 SEO that bad boy. How?
-------------------------

YouTube shorts. I‚Äôd start a channel on pressure washing in my
local city like this. (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/vqh3hrhnwn9xl0fg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9Gb3JldmVyU2VsZkVtcGxveWVk
) I‚Äôd rack up a lot of views. I‚Äôd tag them ‚ÄòAustin‚Äô and ‚Äòlocal‚Äô
to drive more customers to me.

------------------
Getting Customers:
------------------

Start low pressure
------------------

If you remember one thing from this, it is to go get your first
five customers before you sell anything. I‚Äôd go knock on all my
neighbors‚Äô doors and tell them:

‚ÄúHi KAREN - I live down the street and own a power washing
business. I just started servicing this area so I‚Äôm giving a
limited offer for this neighborhood for this month since I‚Äôll be
here already.‚Äù
I‚Äôd show them your ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô shots (taken from the
internet) and lock up as many as I can. I‚Äôd document this entire
process so I can outsource it next.

The second I got one customer, I‚Äôd ask them to post about it on
Nextdoor while I sat there with them. I‚Äôd tell them how important
reviews are and make them feel like they are helping a small
business. Most people won‚Äôt do that. TUG ON THE HEART.

Why?
----

Nextdoor is perfect for two things ‚Äì complaining about kids
shooting fireworks in your neighborhood and asking for
recommendations on small businesses.

Go to Nextdoor right now and search for pressure washing or power
washing. I did and just in my neighborhood, there are plenty of
people asking for recommendations:

‚Äã

Harass your local realtor
-------------------------

If you‚Äôve ever sold a house, you know the first thing your
realtor asks you to do is pressure wash the entire exterior. Why?
Because it washes 10 years of age off your house. If you can get
in good with 4-5 realtors, you‚Äôll be busy for months.

New house who dis?
------------------

New home buyers are in BUY mode. Look up recently sold listings
and attack.

---------------------
Now, let‚Äôs talk brand
---------------------

You aren‚Äôt just a power washing company.
----------------------------------------

You are a surprise-reveal company, a make-my-old-thing-new
company. Times are tough. Most people can‚Äôt afford a new house,
or an entire paint job, or a new fence. But you can give them
that for a fraction of the cost. Remember, people pay premiums
for feelings.

We are cleaning up old things as a company, our delivery method
just happens to be power washing. But our brand and promise is
that we help you live better. We make houses homes.

That‚Äôs the American dream. That is a big promise. Here‚Äôs how we
make them feel something.

Create a magical moment
-----------------------

I‚Äôd do something ridiculous for every home I pressure-washed. I‚Äôd
pick a corner somewhere and PW the initials of the family in the
cement. Then I‚Äôd have them come out and tell them a story about
it. Maybe even a little calling card like the one below. Tell
them if they ever want to surprise their kid or loved one, you‚Äôll
come spray a lil message on the house. Just get that Instagram
tag.

‚Äã

Reviews - but don‚Äôt suck
------------------------

In Austin, the very top businesses only have 200-400 reviews. I‚Äôd
go ham on reviews.

‚Äã
Use review software like NiceJob (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/m2h7h5ho4o6gvpbm/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZXQubmljZWpvYi5jb20v
) with your CRM, so you send an automated SMS text immediately
after their job is finished, leading them to Facebook/GMB to
leave a review.

If that goes unanswered, follow the SMS text with two well-timed
follow-up emails. But I‚Äôd make them fun‚Ä¶ for the first one I‚Äôd
have a funny meme:

‚Äã
For the second one, I‚Äôd send them the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô
pictures. I‚Äôd include a one-liner like:

‚ÄúYour review actually keeps me in business, our love language is
good reviews. ;) Thank you for taking the time out of your day to
support a small biz. Most people won‚Äôt but you did!‚Äù

Influencer campaigns:
---------------------

Remember when I mentioned power washing porn? It‚Äôs an entire
phenomenon with 1.64M subscribers on Reddit (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/3ohphkhqpq5o07tr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL3Bvd2Vyd2FzaGluZ3Bvcm4v
). I‚Äôd get local ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù in my area to let me come power
wash their place or business and film the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô.
In Austin, I‚Äôd be hitting up, ahem, Codie Sanchez, Tim Ferriss,
Noah Kagan, and local business owners who have real estate. Then
offer a bunch of micro-influencers some free services and cool
content in exchange for them posting about us. We‚Äôve talked about
micro-influencers before, as that‚Äôs how Isaac would pay (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/wvu9p5mqrrcgh5vog42c7/e0hph7hkrk3p68a8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vdGlueS1ob3RlbC01NTBrLXlvdXItZmlyc3QteWVhci8=
) about $500 to get $20-50k in value.

How does this value shake out?
------------------------------

* Let‚Äôs say we get 50 influencers doing this hyper-locally. We
get 50 clients from each of them over the course of a year.
That‚Äôs $100k each, which is $5M in revenue.
* Let‚Äôs say we let them keep 10% of the revenue as an affiliate
fee. That‚Äôs still $4.5M. At 30% profit, it‚Äôs $1.35M to our bottom
line.

So, between influencers, reviews that jack up SEO, more clients,
adding services, etc., we‚Äôre looking at a $3-5 Million EBITDA or
profit business.

Now here‚Äôs the cool part. This business has magic in it when it
comes to sales price because it has these 7 things:

* Systems and process - reviews, scheduling, etc.
* Re-occurring revenue - subscriptions and contracts
* Reviews, online presence, and trust
* Protected margins of 30+%
* Client acquisition strategy
* Moated strategy
* Opportunity for scale and efficiencies

This is the exact type of business private equity companies buy
just like these guys:

)‚Äã

-----------------------------------------------------------
So what would this company be worth after you‚Äôve done this?
-----------------------------------------------------------

A $4 Million profit (EBITDA) business would be worth 6-10X its
profit, or $24M to $40M, to a private equity company.

You just turned a side hustle people laugh at into $40 Million.
It isn‚Äôt easy, but it‚Äôs definitely not rocket science.

Or you use all your newfound social media followers like Bin
Blasters did and create a franchise. Those sell for even more
money.

You still think my businesses are boring?

Today in 10 minutes or less, you‚Äôll get:
----------------------------------------

* Don‚Äôt get all cranky pants with me now
* The weight of 'shoulds' on all our shoulders this season
* Here are a few of my favorite things üé∂üéµ

MENTAL MODEL
------------

------------------------
First, Stop the Nonsense
------------------------

Traditions are beautiful and important, but TBH when I see
Vogue‚Äôs list of ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù that include $12,500 pearl drop
earrings, I become concerned that I no longer understand the
definition of the words must and have. So this year, we are not
going to inundate you with a list of nonsense gifts under the
guise of helping you overspend this holiday.

Instead, we hope this is the guide to giving people and yourself
stuff that actually makes your lives materially better, by
gaining strong minds, bank accounts, and bodies.

Honestly, what is wrong with humanity that this is sent out as a
list of things people actually want? Dear sweet angel above‚Ä¶
cranky pants? And you wear those?

‚Äã

---------------------------
Contrarian Mental Framework
---------------------------

I scrawl the words on my whiteboard, a daily reminder.

‚ÄúJust because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean that you should.‚Äù
Stepping back, I nod. Yes, today‚Äôs world is replete with shoulds.
I feel them heavy on my shoulders.

Should say this‚Ä¶

Should do that‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve never quite understood why for so many the term, ‚Äòlive and
let live‚Äô is a personal affront. A red flag waved in the enraged
bull‚Äôs eyes. When did we become each other‚Äôs keepers? When did we
decide we knew better for another than they knew for themselves?

Want vs should. The life well created is the one that allows more
of the former and doesn‚Äôt mandate more of the latter.

It‚Äôs a lesson we‚Äôd do well to remember.

Should‚Äôs are aplenty during the holidays. Doesn‚Äôt mean they are
musts.

GIFTS THAT WON'T END UP AT GOODWILL
-----------------------------------

-----------------------
A Contrarian Gift Guide
-----------------------

‚Äã
Here are the rules:

* We‚Äôre not listing a single thing we don‚Äôt own and actively use.
Because that‚Äôs lame.
* We‚Äôre highlighting small businesses we love as well as some of
my favorite investments. SKIN IN THE GAME.

Did we just rhyme? Think so.

Favorite Things for Civilizing the Mind
---------------------------------------

‚Äã
* ‚ÄúNever Split the Difference (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/9qhzhnhgex8o7mt9/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNWSnpCWTM=
)‚Äù ‚Äì You will single-handedly increase your income by reading
about negotiation through Chris Voss. Read it twice.
* Comedy is the last bastion of the truth ‚Äì Comedians may be the
last reprieve from PC-ness or censorship. Give ‚Äôem tickets (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/3ohphkhqkr8ew5cr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlja2V0c29uc2FsZS5jb20vdGhlYXRlci9qb2Utcm9nYW4vMTE0P2djbGlkPUNqMEtDUWlBLUphY0JoQzBBUklzQUl4eWJ5T01rRmxZSTRMcFZncnFvSGtEU1A1RkJBRTFrcjlGUVk5VUNkOVU2OEI5TjZyT3A3bjZTaU1hQXRTZEVBTHdfd2NC
), make ‚Äòem laugh, and give ‚Äòem a little bit of truth.
* A candle and a minute ‚Äì My husband and I light a candle each
night (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/n2hohvhnlg4zdzu6/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNXMW13Smo=
) and we talk and think about what we want to create and bring
into the world over a glass of wine. Maybe we‚Äôre woo-woo, but
there‚Äôs a crystal in that bad boy and damn if half the things we
visualize don‚Äôt come through.
* ‚ÄúThe Daily Stoic (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/48hvheh07934oxcx/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNWRmp2eXM=
)‚Äù ‚Äì A habit, 60 seconds. Reading this book in the morning sets
the tone for a day well lived.
* ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Search for Himself (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/wnh2hghrl4dezls7/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNpS3lkOFE=
)‚Äù ‚Äì Not to be confused with ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning‚Äù, Rollo
May‚Äôs book is transcendent about how to architect your life.
* Epsom salts + this holder (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/reh8hohqo7pg8ph2/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNCbWIzZms=
) ‚Äì Baths have a slew of health and mind benefits. Add
detoxification while reading one of the books on this list.
Nothing like relaxing while you‚Äôre learning.

Favorite Things for Making Savage the Body
------------------------------------------

‚Äã
* ‚ÄãHydrate Packets (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/08hwh9hmpx4388sl/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzN1eGJ5aVc=
) ‚Äì Drinking water is such a low-lift activity for life
extension, energy, and cognition. And yet, I suck at it. So, I
use these daily.
* ‚ÄãHalf Caff Coffee (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/8ghqhohg738reeik/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FzYWJsYW5jYWNvZmZlZS5jby9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9uZXcvcHJvZHVjdHMvc29icmVtZXNh
) ‚Äì So you‚Äôre not an anxious mess like I was prior to going half
caffeine in my coffee. Plus the owner is a small business bud.
* ‚ÄãLadder App (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/vqh3hrhnq46w2xag/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS91cy9hcHAvbGFkZGVyLXN0cmVuZ3RoLXRyYWluaW5nL2lkMTUwMjkzNjQ1Mw==
) ‚Äì I invested in this company and use this workout app daily. I
love the videos that explain every rep and set, the auto
countdown clock, and the tracking.
* ‚ÄãKettlebells (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/l2hehmhod4px5nb6/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNIcGdVN3c=
) ‚Äì My husband is notorious for buying them and giving them away
at birthday parties. They could literally be the only piece of
equipment you use if done right.
* Sauna ‚Äì I KNOW it‚Äôs a big buy, but I use it daily and think I‚Äôm
a saner, healthier human for it. So say the 1,000‚Äôs of studies on
it as well.
* ‚ÄãTheragun (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/m2h7h5hol9x4k9hm/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNIbVBoZm8=
) ‚Äì The joy of placing this thing all over my sore or tired body
is better than ___.
* Athletic Greens ‚Äì Hate vitamins? Hate kale? Me too. So I take
this daily and it doesn‚Äôt taste like dirty medicine.
* ‚ÄãPso-Rite (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/dpheh0hq2kxpzwsm/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNZNFI2bjM=
) ‚Äì Back hurts? Tight hips? Sit too much trying to make money?
This is my go-to. It feels awful, but it fixes everything.

Favorite Things for Building the Bank Account
---------------------------------------------

‚Äã
* ‚ÄãHow to Buy a Profitable Business w/o Millions Course (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/e0hph7hkdezr92s8/aHR0cHM6Ly91bmNvbnZlbnRpb25hbGFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy5jb20vY291cnNlcy9idXlpbmctYS1zbWFsbC1idXNpbmVzcy8=
)‚Äì Skip the Harry Potter special set and give them the gift of
business buying. This is a shameless plug, but you‚Äôll thank me
also when the average member gets 10x the cost.
* Gift a stock ‚Äì Yup, Timmy can be the proud owner of AAPL. Also,
Daddy gets a tax credit. NBD.
* ‚ÄãHere.co (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/7qh7h8h0x8env4sz/aHR0cDovL2hlcmUuY28v
) ‚Äì Invest in Airbnbs without any of the work. We‚Äôve invested in
two of their deals.
* ‚ÄãBeehiiv (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/owhkhqh40neq34av/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVlaGlpdi5jb20v
) ‚Äì This is actually free to start. So if you‚Äôve ever thought
about building an email list and newsletter, this software is my
favorite and we invested in it. You could also add this course (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/z2hghnhom7zl93cp/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFuLXRoaW5raW5nLnRoaW5raWZpYy5jb20vY291cnNlcy95b3VyLTEtbWlsbGlvbi1uZXdzbGV0dGVy
) which is not free, but every step I used to build Contrarian
Thinking.
* Virtual Assistant ‚Äì The best money you will ever spend is on
doing high-level tasks and outsourcing low-level ones. I hired my
VAs from Support Shepherd (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/p8heh9h9pdeqk4fq/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VzaGVwaGVyZC5jb20vP2FmbWM9Y29kaWU=
).
* Liability into assets #1 ‚Äì Buy an airstream (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/x0hph6hn4zmq89a5/aHR0cHM6Ly9ydi5jYW1waW5nd29ybGQuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3QvQUlSU1RSRUFNL0ZMWUlORyUyMENMT1VEP2xvY2F0aW9ucz1uYXRpb253aWRlJnNjcGM9ZHNhLWdzLWN3cnYtbmF0JmdjbGlkPUNqMEtDUWlBLUphY0JoQzBBUklzQUl4eWJ5TzZ1dm9zZU9zZF9zQU5razl2OVBzbkRjeUhBZldCV01MVFl4bklNQnpEeV95aTc4dXVic01hQW5SOEVBTHdfd2NCJmdjbHNyYz1hdy5kcw==
), enjoy it, but rent it out when you‚Äôre not using it to cashflow
it. Some recession resistance as well with lower-tier vacations.
* ‚ÄãProperty Management Business in a Box (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/6qheh8hp3w49voio/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2RpZWxvdmVzcHJvcGVydHltYW5hZ2VtZW50LmNvbS8=
) ‚Äì I am gifting this one to my family. Don‚Äôt tell them. We
partnered with a guy who does $2M a year by managing long-term
rentals and he shared his playbook on it with us. THIS IS A BIG
investment, but I want my family to have a business they can run
that they can retire on.

Best Under $100 Ever Spent:
---------------------------

* ‚ÄãTraveling iPhone mic (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/kkhmh6h8oepxg4al/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNGYmx3dnU=
) ‚Äì Tell your kids to stop watching TikTok and YouTube and make
some instead. Earn money as a creator not a consumer.
* ‚ÄãOtterbox cellphone case (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/58hvh7h540w6p3i6/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNWV2NHczI=
) ‚Äì Have a tendency to hurl your phone around like it wronged
you? This thing will save thousands a year.
* Cleaners for the holidays ‚Äì Don‚Äôt give me crap, clean up my
crap. I love cleaning gift cards (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/25h2hoh7qgxmr6a3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFpZHMuY29tL291ci1jb21wYW55L2dpZnQtY2VydGlmaWNhdGVzLw==
). Is that weird?
* Food is good ‚Äì But dull knives suck. My husband is obsessed
with a good knife. (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/qvh8h7h8lv3kgwul/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNIbDdUTUU=
)‚Äã
* ‚ÄãGua shua (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h723424cg/g3hnh5he0n2q7wir/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzNVSW1wQjY=
) ‚Äì Vain. Yes. Works. Yes. You rub it on your face to sculpt and
try to beat up Father Time.

NOT TO BUY LIST: (Worst $ Ever Spent)
-------------------------------------

* No fancy candles, please ‚Äì I buy mine at HomeGoods, organic and
soy for $12.99. $50 candles are criminal.
* Any sort of sweet ‚Äì I know people mean well when they send
cookies or cupcakes etc., but it‚Äôs kinda like gifting bad
decisions. All I see is cellulite. Please keep thanks.
* Expensive coffee table books ‚Äì Hack: go to a used bookstore or
better yet a Goodwill shop. They basically give those away. Also,
call it ‚Äúvintage‚Äù, i.e. you‚Äôre recycling but making it fancy.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the list. My hope is you never have to try on a
badly fitting sweater or cram into your suitcase a slew of things
that will eventually end up in the garbage can. What if we use
this time instead to gift health, wealth, and clear thinking?

I can then just barely tolerate another year of Mariah Carey‚Äôs
Christmas music.

Buckle up. We‚Äôve got your back.

WHEN THE GREEN STUFF CALLS
--------------------------

-------------------
The homegrown kind‚Ä¶
-------------------

‚Äã
Meet Jonah. He‚Äôs one of us. An avid reader of Contrarian Thinking
who makes $700k+ a year selling what? Hippie rabbit food, no
joke.

It all started with a tomato‚Äîwell, a handful of ‚Äòem really.

Flashback to a younger Jonah, working an office job at a company
that regulated pension funds while he was in university.

Jonah had been growing his own veggies and microgreens for years
after his dad taught him how in his childhood backyard. Cute,
right?

Some call it father-son bonding. I call it generational
entrepreneurship.

So, he didn‚Äôt think much when he offered his co-workers one of
his garden-fresh cherry tomatoes while waiting in line for a
microwave in the office cafeteria.

The look on his co-worker‚Äôs face said it all: it was the best
cherry tomato they‚Äôd ever tasted.

But the tomato died on the vine from there.

)‚Äã

When Jonah graduated college, the golden handcuffs came
a-callin‚Äô‚Äîthis time in the form of a job as a commercial real
estate appraiser.

Only problem was he knew on his very first day that this was not
his scene.

So, he did what any Millennial does: he started growing a little
green in his parent‚Äôs spare bedroom. Not pot, you delinquents.

Now Jonah is the founder of one of the largest vertical
microgreens farms in Canada. Quite the power greens glow up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
And he did it with less than $700 of equipment and a packet of
seeds
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Back in 2013, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of info on how to create a biz
like this, so Jonah learned it all on his own. He figured:

‚ÄúHow hard can it be to grow a few plants?‚Äù
Turns out, not quite as easy as he thought. His first tray of
microgreens was inedible, but he had a vision and could see the
Canadian dollar signs, even then.

His strategy back then was to reinvest all his profit back into
the business: new software, different seed and crop varieties,
and various at-home setups.

He tried basil. He tried kale. He tried MANY varieties of
lettuce, but he kept coming back to microgreens.

They‚Äôre one of the most profitable crop varieties and one of the
easiest to grow.

It was a season full of experimentation, but in his first twelve
months, Jonah cleared $60k in revenue. Not bad for spending less
than $1k to get set up.

Now for my favorite part. Let‚Äôs break down some numbers.

* One 6ft indoor plant rack = ~2k in revenue each month
* If the profit margin is about 85%, you‚Äôre looking at ~$1.7k in
profit in a month. But let‚Äôs say you give yourself a little more
wiggle room.
* For example, after outgrowing his parent‚Äôs spare bedroom, Jonah
got his own facility and retrofitted a 5,000 sqft commercial
space with up to 8 levels of plant bays per rack.
* After scaling up and signing some pretty big contracts with
local restaurants and suppliers, he continued to grow the biz.
* 8 years after getting started, Jonah made $700k in 2021 and has
managed to keep a 40% profit margin as he‚Äôs scaled.

He‚Äôs now on track to be a millionaire thanks to butter lettuce
and little gems.

)‚Äã

-----------------------------------------------------------------
A few things you should know right off the bat about this biz
model:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Microgreens are considered any crop that‚Äôs harvested after
sprouting‚Äîtypically 7 to 21 days of growth after planting. Think
micro broccoli, cabbage, basil, cilantro, and kale.
* They‚Äôre also one of the most profitable legal crops because
they‚Äôre cheap to grow but $$$ to buy as a consumer. At $20-$50 an
order, we‚Äôre talking about a gross profit margin of ~80%.
* Microgreens are up to 20x more nutritional (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg7gv9zsl/48hvheh07rlm73ux/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJ1ZWxlYWZtYXJrZXQuY29tL2Jsb2dzL2FydGljbGVzL21pY3JvZ3JlZW5zLW1vcmUtbnV0cml0aW91cy10aGFuLW1hdHVyZS12ZWdldGFibGVzLWFuZC1oZXJicw==
) than your standard power greens pack at Whole Foods. They‚Äôre
also 100% responsible for why your favorite brunch foods are so
effing expensive (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg7gv9zsl/wnh2hghrlw7qlzc7/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vd2h5LXRoZS1mLWlzLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmctc28tZXhwZW5zaXZlLw==
).
* You only need $1000 for the equipment to get started (which he
made back in the first couple of months).
* It‚Äôs highly scalable. You can get started with a standard-sized
indoor plant rack that‚Äôs about 6 feet wide and stack them
vertically to minimize space. Want to double your revenue? Just
add six more feet of storage or stack vertically and you‚Äôre in
business.
* You can apparently do this side hustle even if you‚Äôre known for
killing every single one of your houseplants. Microgreens are
easy AF to grow, especially with the help of specialty courses
like the one Jonah teaches (

). Hit reply if you want me to try this‚Ä¶ I kind of think this
would make a SWEET YouTube video. Let‚Äôs see if Jonah‚Äôs right.

Looks a little like Breaking Bad meets Willie Nelson if you ask
me.

Just to give you an idea‚Ä¶ if you want to start small, this photo
from 2013 is an example of what the early days of your setup
could look like.

Nothing fancy‚Äîjust a rack, some lights, and a little TLC.

-------------------------------------------------------
Here‚Äôs how to get started growing your own microgreens:
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Find your space and grab your equipment
-----------------------------------------------

Again, you‚Äôll only need about six feet of indoor space to get
started. Window light not required. If you‚Äôve got room in your
office, a spare bedroom, the cupboard under the stairs‚Äîhell, even
in your guest bathroom‚Äîyou‚Äôve got what you‚Äôll need to grow your
own microgreens.

Step 2: Grow your greens
------------------------

Next comes putting seed to dirt. Basically, you‚Äôll prep to plant
and then harvest your first round o‚Äô greens about one to three
weeks after you first get started.

If a green thumb just isn‚Äôt on your list of most redeeming
qualities, you can leverage a software called VertiGrow (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg7gv9zsl/8ghqhohg7ldo82ak/aHR0cHM6Ly92ZXJ0aWdyb3cuaW8v
) that will create a daily checklist for you to manage your crop
rotation and watering schedules.

Step 3: Start finding your customers
------------------------------------

When you‚Äôre first starting out, you‚Äôll most likely operate under
a direct-to-consumer business model and deliver your product
directly to your customer.

Aka schlepping your greens to a local ag share, farmer‚Äôs market,
or even right to your customer‚Äôs doorstep.

However you do it, you want to create a subscription model and
schedule deliveries immediately.

Jonah started out by landing customers in a subscription model
with local restaurants and scheduling produce pickups or home
deliveries on the same days each week to make the harvesting and
driving more efficient.

Two other very important things to know:

* Most chefs and restaurants will order about $65-$70 of produce
per week, while your average household customer won‚Äôt pay more
than $15. Household customers are also known for pausing orders
frequently and can be considered a more volatile customer.
* Restaurants will require you to create connections with the
head chef or kitchen staff which might be a barrier to entry, but
you‚Äôll also make 4X in weekly sales.

Now that his business has scaled, Jonah has specially branded
packaging, but for years, his products were in small plastic
containers or produce bags.

)‚Äã

-------------------------------------------------------
This business model is sunk if your sales process sucks
-------------------------------------------------------

The trick to cracking the code of a business model as complex as
this one is setting up a subscription model from day one.

Ideally, you and your customer (whether it‚Äôs a restaurant or home
delivery) decide on a one or two-day-a-week product drop (likely
early Monday or Tuesday to replenish after the weekend, and
Thursday or Friday to replenish before the weekend).

Then, you‚Äôll need to make sure that you have enough microgreens
for each round you harvest.

Eventually, the question will be whether you need to add
additional trays or if it‚Äôs better to keep your microgreens
business at its current size. This riddle does not always have an
easy answer.

----------------------------------
A few things I‚Äôd do if it were me‚Ä¶
----------------------------------

* Leverage social media as a sales engine: There‚Äôs a lot of
potential here to use social media as a growth platform, based
purely on aesthetics. If you‚Äôre sourcing local customers, I‚Äôd
probably stick to Facebook and Instagram. But if you‚Äôve got quite
an aesthetic setup, TikTok might also be a good idea.
* Set up your backend with scaling in mind: Because this model is
extremely scalable (like stack a rack on top of another one,
easy) I‚Äôd probably focus more on getting systems and processes
set up from the beginning. A CRM and basic sales platform like
Stripe (or even Venmo, as long as you‚Äôre organized) will help you
once you start racking up repeat customers.
* Be a vigilante about CONSISTENT product quality: This business
is highly unforgivable. If you don‚Äôt deliver quality ingredients
every. single. time, your customer can easily head over to their
local grocer or possibly even find another vendor. Do what you
can to make your products an 11 out of 10 and you‚Äôll be more
likely to attract repeat and referral customers.

I love this business model. Did you know that one out of four
grocery stores in the US is owned by a large chain? How about we
go local, micro, and take back the businesses all around us?
Because ya know, f*ck Monsanto.

Hey crew, it's us again. I see you getting all cozy as you settle
in for another holiday season, Contrarian Thinking styleüéÅ. If you
didn't already know, you're our favorite. Without y'all, none of
this is possible. That's what's on our minds this holiday
season...along with copious amounts of eggnog and country
Christmas music (eek). Glad I got that off my chest. Now, back to
business.

PARK THAT THOUGHT
-----------------

-----------------------------
Where DO All the Big Toys Go?
-----------------------------

‚Äã
Ever since learning how one guy was making $20k a month painting
lines on a parking lot (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/p8heh9h9p8vpr8hq/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vaG93LXRvLXF1aXQteW91ci1qb2ItYW5kLW1ha2UtdGhvdXNhbmRzLWZyb20tc3RyaXBpbmcv
), I‚Äôve had parking on the brain.

But not just the ones outside your local Walmart. It really got
me thinking.

How many people own RVs, boats, large recreational equipment, or
otherwise bulky outdoor items?

Apparently, 11.84 million people own boats in the US, and another
11.3 million own RVs. That seems like an F-ton.

F-TON being, of course, the highly technical term for ‚Äúa whole
bunch‚Äù.

So I poured a glass of vino and hit up LoopNet for another round
of my fave late-night game: ‚ÄúWhat Would Happen if I Bought This
Business?‚Äù

Once I started my search, I found a decently sized boat storage
space like these ones (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/x0hph6hn4xg4kkh5/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVjbmF0aW9uc3RvcmFnZS5jb20vYm9hdC1ydi1zdG9yYWdlLWxvY2F0aW9ucy9mbC9lZGdld2F0ZXIv
), out in Edgewater, Florida.

* The owner had it listed on LoopNet for $62,900
* Factor in the 50 spaces available at their current rate of
$65/month and say you get it to a 50% occupancy rate
* You‚Äôre looking at $19.5k in yearly revenue

I‚Äôd also add that storage facilities see upwards of a 41 percent
margin (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/6qheh8hp30q3xzso/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RvcmFibGUuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlcy9sZWFybi9pcy1hLXNlbGYtc3RvcmFnZS1idXNpbmVzcy1wcm9maXRhYmxlLw==
). Harrumph.

)‚Äã
We‚Äôve already written about purchasing land for campsites and
parking spots in high-traffic cities (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/58hvh7h54le432s6/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vMjEtd2F5cy10by1jYXNoZmxvdy1uby1vbmUtdGFsa3MtYWJvdXQtJWYwJTlmJWE0JTkwLw==
). So why not buy land and rent space to all those RV, boat,
recreational vehicle, and Seadoo people?

You‚Äôre definitely going to need a lawyer, some savvy real estate
folks, and probably a friend in your back pocket who knows
construction just in case.

And if you‚Äôre scratching your head and thinking:

‚ÄúReally? Parked boats?‚Äù
Allow me to show you why this is one to watch.

Gary Wojtaszek, who‚Äôs best known for building data centers in his
real estate portfolio, recently opened an RV and boat storage
company when he sold his last data center.

After starting his new boat and RV storage company in August
2022, he acquired 10 locations in six weeks (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/25h2hoh7qn5qlzh3/aHR0cHM6Ly9ydmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1lbnRyZXByZW5ldXItYmV0cy1ydi1zdG9yYWdlLWlzLW5leHQtYmlnLXRoaW5nLTIv
). WEEKS.

When all is said and done, he‚Äôll have thrown about a third of a
$BILLION$ toward this business model, with hopes of scaling to
400 locations with small business operators in the future.

HOW TO PLAY IT
--------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Why is a Server Farm Real Estate Lover Getting into Boring Biz
Buying?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Because he knows that local (i.e. drivable) distances and
staycations become the #1 way to vacation during a recession.

‚ÄãRV sales were up 6% in 2020 (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/qvh8h7h8lqxlemcl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29ydmluZy5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vcnYtaW5kdXN0cnktYXNzb2NpYXRpb24tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdGF0aXN0aWNz
) (~430k units sold). People need somewhere to store them. Same
goes for boats and any other leisurely equipment.

Extra Space Storage, a real estate investment company that
moonlights in boat parking lots, has traded about $387 million in
storage stock (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/g3hnh5he0xv0g4ar/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcy53YWxsbWluZS5jb20vbnlzZS9leHIvb2ZmaWNlci8yMjEyNDI3L25vYWgtc3ByaW5nZXI=
) with many more millions to come.

Equally impressive, slightly smaller scale, is Onewater Maritime.
They‚Äôve traded about $82 million (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/9qhzhnhgen7e45h9/aHR0cHM6Ly93YWxsbWluZS5jb20vbmFzZGFxL29uZXcvb2ZmaWNlci8yMTQyNTM4L2RhdmlkLWstd2l0dHk=
) in stock and bought ~579k storage units worth $4 million in the
last three years.

If I were going to turn my wine-induced internet rabbit hole into
an actual business idea, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Evaluate your market with a fine-toothed comb and look for a
good location (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/3ohphkhqkvwkxktr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlc2VsZnN0b3JhZ2UuY29tL3ZlaGljbGUtc3RvcmFnZS9mZWFzaWJpbGl0eS1jb25zaWRlcmF0aW9ucy1idWlsZGluZy1ib2F0cnYtc2VsZi1zdG9yYWdl
)‚Äã

* Near, but not within, a large city (100,000 and larger). If you
get too close, it‚Äôll be too $$$. REMEMBER: you‚Äôre not necessarily
looking for a year-round city population of 100,000. You‚Äôre
looking for the HIGHEST population that city has during tourist
season.
* If you want to increase occupancy for your storage space,
search for places near lakes or other large bodies of water (for
da boats) and campgrounds (for da RVs).
* Find a location with ~$70k in average household income. That
number surprised me, too, but 61% of those who boat have an
annual household income of $75K and below (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/n2hohvhnledl24h6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xOS9ib2F0LXNhbGVzLXRvb2stb2ZmLWR1cmluZy1wYW5kZW1pYy1kZWFsZXJzLWNhbnQta2VlcC11cC13aXRoLWRlbWFuZC5odG1s
) and the average RV owner has an income of about $68K (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/48hvheh07ko7wocx/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYWR2ZW50dXJldHJhdmVsZXJzLmNvbS9sYXRlc3QtcnYtaW5kdXN0cnktc3RhdGlzdGljcy10cmVuZHMtZGF0YS0yMDIxLw==
).
* Check into areas with a high concentration of RVs and boats, or
better yet, both within 1-10 miles of your facility. (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/3ohphkhqkvwkxktr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlc2VsZnN0b3JhZ2UuY29tL3ZlaGljbGUtc3RvcmFnZS9mZWFzaWJpbGl0eS1jb25zaWRlcmF0aW9ucy1idWlsZGluZy1ib2F0cnYtc2VsZi1zdG9yYWdl
) P.S. this one‚Äôs free, but the cheapest way to get this info is
from open-source data for the state/city/county you‚Äôre looking to
buy or build storage in. Here‚Äôs a map of the # of registered
boats in Texas, by city, for example, from https://data.texas.gov
(
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/reh8hohqon8o42b2/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXRhLnRleGFzLmdvdi8=
).

)‚Äã
2. Ask for the right numbers if you‚Äôre buying an existing
facility

This one rings true if you‚Äôre going to purchase a storage lot
that‚Äôs already been built. Here are the big ones to look for:

* Historical vacancy rates - You‚Äôll want to know how much
capacity the existing facility has and then cross-reference it
with their vacancy rates to see how much usage they are getting
for the amount of cash flow they currently have.
* Competitor rates - You‚Äôll want to know how much your
competitors are charging in your area and see how your new
business compares. You‚Äôll also get a clear idea of whether
there‚Äôs an opportunity to increase prices.
* # of units available - Are you walking into a turnkey biz
purchase? Or do you need to do any additional marketing to up the
number of units that are being rented out?

Market evaluation is more of an art and less of a science. Once
you have your market evaluation factors down, it‚Äôs time to
evaluate.

3. Buy yourself a piece of land (but only if you wanna)

If you‚Äôre going the route of building out your storage space, the
biggest time suck will be finding the right piece of land.

Your big hurdle is going to be navigating the zoning and city
ordinances. This can be a real b*tch.

https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/08hwh9hmpq8pv9al/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucml2aWVyYW1hcmluYS5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTkvMDIvMjAxODA1MjMtcml2aWVyYS1tYXJpbmEwNTIxLTEwMzB4Njg3LmpwZw==
)‚Äã
If the land is already zoned commercial, that‚Äôs probably your
best bet, IMO. You can always attempt to change your zoning with
the help of city officials, but that also means getting to
cashflow is going to take a little longer.

But, if you‚Äôre into it, here‚Äôs where to look and what to do:

* Check out Zoning Point (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/vqh3hrhnq85ql3sg/aHR0cHM6Ly96b25pbmdwb2ludC5jb20v
) or search Google for the Assessor Office of the county you are
looking to purchase or where you‚Äôre looking for zoning
information. Make sure you know which county the land is in and
the parcel number before your search.
* According to them, at least, Land.com (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/m2h7h5holwrlvnsm/aHR0cDovL2xhbmQuY29tLw==
) is the BIG player to help you find your patch of land online.
Try some of these search terms on LoopNet (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/7qh7h8h0x3gxq9hz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG9vcG5ldC5jb20v
) or some of the other sub-sites: ‚ÄúCommercial Land‚Äù, ‚ÄúLand‚Äù, or
‚ÄúParking‚Äù. Sometimes, these spaces show up on sites like Zillow
and Redfin, so you might consider searching and filtering for
Lots/Land on your fave home finder application.
* Alternatively, find an existing land storage business and just
buy it. ****Our fave recommendation, by the way. None of the
above steps are negated by this step; you still need to evaluate
your market and find land, just a big part of the work MAY have
been done for you. (Be cautious: maybe they‚Äôre looking to sell
their existing storage land because no one is using it!)

And now for the thing that nobody is talking about: on-site
repairs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The annual maintenance that literally every. single. customer.
will need each year but doesn‚Äôt want to have to deal with.

Say hello to your new revenue stream.

‚ÄãPhoto source: Twitter (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxdd2k8fg/owhkhqh405z0pgfv/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9qZGtsZWluMzMvc3RhdHVzLzE1OTE2Nzk1MDU0NTM5NjEyMTY=
)‚Äã
Let‚Äôs run some quick numbers, shall we?

JD is saying boaters will spend 5-10% of the boat‚Äôs value on
ANNUAL repairs. Let‚Äôs call it 8%.

If your customer‚Äôs boat is $50k, you‚Äôre looking at an additional
$4k in revenue from a single boat.

With storage rent of $780 per boat per year, say, you just 5X‚Äôed
your annual revenue per customer. If you‚Äôve got 50 spots
available to rent out each year and only sell 50% of them, you‚Äôre
saying hello to six figures in revenue ($120k to be exact).

I‚Äôm not saying this is the only way to run a storage business,
but if I could buy one of these bad boys, add it to my portfolio,
find an operator, and add some on-site repairs, I‚Äôd do it. I bet
it‚Äôd kinda be like a Jimmy Buffett song, hold the pi√±a, add the
profit.

Where there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way‚Äîright, fam?

CONTRARIAN THINKING FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------

-----------------
The SWOT Analysis
-----------------

Strengths. Weaknesses. Opportunities. Threats.

It‚Äôs a framework those of us in business, consulting, or
investing had drilled into our heads. A way to measure not hope
and dreams of what a situation might be, but what it actually is.

‚Äã
If I look out on the US right now, I see many strengths and
opportunities. Yet I see one glaring weakness. It is‚Ä¶ us. Only
about 17% of Americans know how to start a fire, 25% of us can‚Äôt
change a flat tire, and 49% of millennials don‚Äôt own any sort of
tool or drill. This article today is about a very dirty, but
profitable and very needed business. As I wrote about it, I came
across this quote from Mike Rowe of the original Dirty Jobs:

‚ÄúBias aside, I can‚Äôt think of a better way to ring in the new
year than with a gentle reminder of what it looks like to work in
places that don‚Äôt offer catered meals, meditations booths,
manicured campuses, interactive walking trails, foosball,
cornhole, red wine on tap, and yoga studios for their employees.
Our country is in the midst of redefining what it means to work
for a living, and for a lot of people, this is it. This is their
wish-fulfillment. To be taken care of. To be catered to. And to
be fair, who can blame them? They are snowflakes, for sure, but
we are the clouds from which the snowflakes fell. And many
companies today are so desperate to attract workers, they‚Äôll do
whatever it takes to please them. I doubt that many have gone as
far as the tech giants here in California, but these videos are
real, and there are many others like them. Videos posted by
employees that celebrate the opposite of ambition. The opposite
of adversity. The opposite of discomfort. The opposite of work
ethic.
Again, bias notwithstanding, thank God shows like #DirtyJobs (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/3ohphkhqk863e4ur/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9leHBsb3JlL3RhZ3MvZGlydHlqb2JzLz9obD1lbg==

) and How America Works are out there, to introduce Americans to
that part of our workforce keeping the lights on and the bridges
standing and the crap flowing in the right direction.‚Äù
-Mike Rowe

Here‚Äôs to those who keep the crap flowing in the right direction,
and stop the blood from flowing in the wrong direction.

-----------------------------------
Blood + Meth Labs + Hoarding, Oh My
-----------------------------------

‚Äã
I‚Äôm a little obsessed with true crime.

Podcasts. Netflix specials. Documentaries. You name it.

So, when I was scrolling through TikTok and saw the scene of a
bloody murder and a meth lab, it was a train wreck I just
couldn‚Äôt stop looking at.

The vid was from Sadie Marshall (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/48hvheh073zm4ksx/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlrdG9rLmNvbS9Ac2FkaWVzcHJvY2xlYW5pbmc=
), a pro crime scene cleaner.

Along with murders, she tackles ‚Äúbiohazard raw sewage, animal
hoarding, and disgusting smell removal (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/wnh2hghrld9qemu7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGFpbHliZWFzdC5jb20vdGlrdG9rcy1sb3ZlLWZvci1jcmltZS1zY2VuZS1jbGVhbnVwLXZpZGVvcy1pcy1ibG9vZHktY29tcGxpY2F0ZWQ=
)‚Äù just to name a few.

I watched a couple of videos (ok, I fell into a multi-hour TikTok
hole) and learned she can make up to $50k just for one cleaning
job. Then I actually went to a job site in Florida with another
crime scene cleanup company.

Dirty business AND unconventional money-making opportunities?
Sign me the f up.

---------------------
Booming Body Business
---------------------

Turns out there are hundreds of private crime scene cleanup crews
in the US.

‚ÄúPeople die every day,‚Äù Sadie said. Not a Disney movie, but
potentially a death-proof business model. Here‚Äôs the story‚Ä¶
Sadie‚Äôs Pro Cleaning first got its start in 2018. Back then, they
only offered commercial and home cleaning services.

But then the pandemic hit. All of a sudden, people didn‚Äôt want
her in their homes anymore.

So, she did what any great entrepreneur would do and pivoted to
cleaning up grisly crime scenes.

Okay, maybe not any great entrepreneur.

Still, she used her biohazard training from the Institute of
Inspection Cleaning and Restoration Certification to good use and
pivoted to crime scene cleanup.

Which also can include cleaning up after epic house-party ragers,
trash hoarders, and, um, explosive bathroom situations.

(Look we‚Äôve all been there, ok?)

One 29-year-old trauma cleaner (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/reh8hohqop9mg4c2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90cmF1bWEtY2xlYW5lci1jbGVhbnMtZGVhZC1ib2RpZXMtbWFrZXMtb3Zlci1taWxsaW9uLXllYXJseS0yMDE5LTg=
) spent just $300 on cleaning equipment (gloves, trash bags,
Costco size bottles of disinfectant, etc.) and turned it into a
booming $300,000/year business. Another started with $15,000 and
now does $12 million dollars a year.

Bottom line: The body biz is booming, and it‚Äôs only going to get
even bigger.

----------------------
Cash for Corpses Recap
----------------------

(This works for any service biz, btw, if you‚Äôre like me and pass
out when giving blood)

* Low upfront cost: A quick trip to Costco for all your materials
* Zero barriers to entry: No certification is needed
* High earning potential: Earn more than $1m by scaling (see
below)
* Always have customers: Death is one of two things assured in
life (the other is my awesome emails)
* Massive potential to go viral: This puts you at an unfair
advantage over other businesses

BY THE NUMBERS
--------------

-----------------------
Let‚Äôs Get Into the Math
-----------------------

Crime scene cleaners make roughly $600/hour doing a job that
requires no degree or certification.

Let‚Äôs assume, to start, it‚Äôs just $200/hour and a part-time gig.
Call it ~5 hours a day, 3 days a week.

~$3,000 in revenue a week

~$300-$500/month for gas and supplies

~$11,500-$11,700/month in the bank

That‚Äôs an earning potential of ~$138,000-$140,400/year just on a
part-time cleaning gig. That‚Äôs $276,000-$280,800/year full-time.

--------------------------------
How Much Would It Cost to Start?
--------------------------------

Let‚Äôs be honest: you‚Äôre a Contrarian. You‚Äôre gonna want more‚Äîand
that means doing this right.

Option 1: You can go the Unconventional Acquisitions (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/8ghqhohg78eomnik/aHR0cHM6Ly91bmNvbnZlbnRpb25hbGFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy5jb20v
) route and buy an entire crime scene cleanup biz with a cash
flow of nearly a million bucks.

‚Äã
BUT, if you don‚Äôt have a cool $2.8 mil lying around, there‚Äôs
Option 2:really getting your hands dirty. Let‚Äôs dive into the
nitty-gritty with all the tools and training you‚Äôll need to start
bagging bodies.

Let‚Äôs start with your personal protective equipment (PPE). If you
freaked out with the rest of the world in the beginning of the
pandemic, you probably have a bunch of this lying around your
house already.

I‚Äôm talking:

* Vinyl gloves: $8 for a pack of 50
* Hazmat suit: $12
* Respirators: $15
* Face masks: $40 for a pack of 50
* Goggles: $13

Equipment total: $88 (all these things can be found on Amazon
btw)

Then you‚Äôll need the cleaning supplies‚Äîand this is where it gets
messy. Every crime scene or massive mess after a party is
different. That means you‚Äôre likely going to need a ton of
different tools for different occasions. To start, it‚Äôs smart to
have a few essentials:

* Shovel: $40
* Mops and bucket: $80
* Medical grade disinfectant: $40
* Industrial deodorizer: $65
* Sponges and cloths: $15-$20
* Hazardous waste disposal bags: $35 for a pack of 150

Tools total: $~275

And of course, you‚Äôre going to want a van or truck to haul all
these things around. That‚Äôll run around $3,000 for a down payment
(assuming it‚Äôll cost $30,000 with a 10% down payment).

All in, you‚Äôre looking at spending roughly $3,365 on equipment.

Of course, you might not want to get your hands dirty quite
yet‚Äîthat means getting training from services like the Hazmat
School, which offers a Crime Scene Clean-up course (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/vqh3hrhnq62oz7tg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGF6bWF0c2Nob29sLmNvbS9jcmltZS1zY2VuZS1jbGVhbi11cC10cmFpbmluZy1jb3Vyc2Uv
) starting at $129. There are also online courses that help you
get certified in OSHA‚Äôs blood-borne pathogen training for as low
as $30.

So, if you really want to ball out, it‚Äôll run you a little under
$3,500 to get started in the body biz‚Äîand you can always do more
for even greater returns.

).

PUMP THE NUMBERS
----------------

----------------------------
Tips to Hit $1m (and Beyond)
----------------------------

#1 Increase your body count
---------------------------

Sure, you can earn $600/hour by yourself. If you want to go far,
go alone. But if you want to make 8 figures‚Ä¶ hire some people.

An example:

You go full-time and hire five people to do your dirty work. The
average cleaning tech earns $40,000/year at 40 hours/week. Your
biz spends about $1,600/month on supplies.

That means:

~$101,733/month net income

~$1,220,800/year in the bank

Boom. You‚Äôre already in the Two Commas Club with a few hires.

Sadie‚Äôs company ballooned from just one person (her) to more than
100 employees since the pandemic. Now she‚Äôs suffering from a
horrible disease called
phone-constantly-ringing-with-new-customers-itis.

#2 Go viral for a cash steroid injection
----------------------------------------

‚ÄúAlmost 80 million people on TikTok know who I am,‚Äù Sadie says.
It even led to her body biz showing up on A&E (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/dpheh0hq2xzelpim/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5LmFldHYuY29tL3Nob3dzL2RpcnR5LXJvdHRlbi1jbGVhbmVycyNlcGlzb2Rlcw==
)‚Äîresulting in tons of new customers.

Take advantage of the internet‚Äôs obsession with true crime and
cleaning videos. Literally, everyone loves a before and after
shot of dirty things turning spotless.

Hell, I wrote a whole article about my obsession with cleaning
porn (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/e0hph7hkdz978dt8/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vZ3Jldy1yZXZlbnVlLWJ5LTQtbWlsbGlvbi1pbi0xMC1taW51dGVzLw==
).

For you, that means firing up TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts,
and even Facebook Reels (for all your boomer friends). Sadie has
plenty of videos of her cleaning up everything from swarms of
death flies (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/7qh7h8h0xev9reaz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlrdG9rLmNvbS9Ac2FkaWVzcHJvY2xlYW5pbmcvdmlkZW8vNzExNTY1NjIzMjIzNjUzNTA4Ng==
) (yes, you read that right) to the houses of hoarders (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/owhkhqh40e3w2zsv/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlrdG9rLmNvbS9Ac2FkaWVzcHJvY2xlYW5pbmcvdmlkZW8vNzEzMTE5NDA5NTk5MjYzODc2Mw==
). This is the ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù school of next-level marketing.

#3. Humans over Zoom calls
--------------------------

I know that compared to our world of instant gratification,
firing humans by Zoom, and largely hijacking ourselves into the
metaverse, this business is hand-to-hand combat. It‚Äôs for the few
who are still willing to get dirt underneath their fingernails.
There‚Äôs a wild thing I‚Äôve seen with those who have been in the
trenches of crime scenes, on battlefields, in emergency rooms,
and it‚Äôs that they can often carry the burden more lightly than
others. The callouses hide their hearts.

Why? These entrepreneurs are the last interaction people will
have with their loved ones through a tragedy. They are the ones
who clean up when no one else will. They can laugh at the horror
because sometimes that‚Äôs all you can do.

So, while everyone else goes and tries to start the next social
app while another one ends, you return a haunted house to a home.
While Andrew Tate shows off his 475th car earned by pimping cam
girls on the internet or telling teenage boys how to cough ‚Äúbe a
man,‚Äù you show up with a van that makes the world a little
cleaner.

The old saying goes: the only two things we can expect in life
are death and taxes.

I say, why not make money doing both (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/5quod4gw33h7hvzkw47f6/z2hghnhomz9el9sp/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vaG93LWEtY3BhLXNoYXZlcy1vZmYtNi1maWd1cmVzLWluLXRheC13aXRoLXRoZXNlLTUtc3RlcHMv
)? And maybe, just maybe, why not make this world a little bit
better? Clean a meth lab out of a community, help a family when
no one else will, and give someone a chance to feel at peace
walking into their home.

Question everything.

** Business Buyers Taking Action

New Deal Tracker from our communities: Work in Progress!

** I Bought a Laundromat... What Did It Cost?
------------------------------------------------------------


** So You Want to Buy a Laundromat?
------------------------------------------------------------
Turns out, kids these days don‚Äôt want to be astronauts. They just want passive income in the form of quarters. If you too got a thing for coins and want to own a laundromat, how much cash will you need?

Obnoxious answer: it depends.

Here‚Äôs the range, we‚Äôve bought a laundromat for $100,000 that netted $67,000 a year, and another for $1.5 million that nets more like $300,000 a year. A laundromat can cost anywhere between $50,000 to over $4 million. The reason is that laundromats fall into a category we call high on the:
* Passive + inexpensive + simple scale

Which is part of the reason we generally like investing in them.


**
How Much Is It to Buy a Laundromat?
------------------------------------------------------------

Good rule of thumb: 2-5x the profit of the laundromat. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the price.

So if a laundromat makes $100,000 a year, it is worth about $200,000 to $500,000. Period. But if you want to get fancy you can use our laundromat deal calculator:


**
Fast tips:
------------------------------------------------------------
* There are two areas that account for 80% of your expenses in laundromats: your lease and your electricity. Check the water + energy bill and your lease and you‚Äôll have 80% of your expenses down.

* You need a long lease with laundromats (5-10+ years) they‚Äôre expensive to build out so you don‚Äôt want to have to move.

* Traditional banks and the SBA don‚Äôt like to finance laundromats, err towards private investors or seller financing.


**
Why do We Like Buying Laundromats?
------------------------------------------------------------

There are seven main reasons we like to buy laundromats (when the deal is right).

1. The Customers Do the Work
Simple, easily understandable business. The customers do most of the work. They bring their own clothes, bring their own supplies, wash, dry and fold the clothes, and take their finished product out themselves.

2. Little Labor Costs
If the customer‚Äôs doing most of the work, that means there‚Äôs little need for extra labor, training, or onboarding costs in the laundromat business. You don‚Äôt need full-time staff ‚Äî or really much staff at all.

3. Upfront Cash
One of the benefits of buying a Laundromat business (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/the-benefits-of-buying-an-existing-laundromat/?mc_cid=78fc85fd06&mc_eid=UNIQID)  is that the customers in the laundromat business pay you right away, which makes tracking your finances much easier. You don‚Äôt have to stress over complicated financial statements ‚Äî you get all your coins in one spot.

4. Recession-Proof
No matter what happens, people always need clean clothes. This business won‚Äôt be as affected by downturns in the economy.

5. Great ROI
The laundry industry has a 20-35% average ROI (https://speedqueencommercial.com/en-us/support/why-invest-in-laundromats/?mc_cid=78fc85fd06&mc_eid=UNIQID)  and nearly a 95% success rate. This makes it a very advantageous investment compared to other riskier businesses.

6. Little Physical Inventory
Compared to something like a restaurant or retail store, laundromats have very little inventory that needs to be stored. This means fewer expenses for physical products and storage facilities.

7. Little Seasonality
People are (hopefully) always cleaning their clothes. The laundry business also is not as weather dependent. In the winter you might have jackets that are bigger but in the summer you‚Äôre getting a bit sweatier.

Pretty straightforward.

One Way to Get Other People To Pay For Your Purchase:
------------------------------------------------------------


** Seller Financing
------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can in fact buy a business with zero of your own (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/seller-financing-bus/?mc_cid=78fc85fd06&mc_eid=UNIQID)  money. It won‚Äôt work every time but it will work over time.

If you‚Äôd like to buy this laundromat above but you don‚Äôt have the capital, what do you do? Ask the seller to seller finance your deal. For you to use the pay from the future profits of the business to pay off the seller over time.

Why would a seller do that?

1. It‚Äôs the way 60% of small business deals get done.
2. It‚Äôs the only way to get a fast sale with you involved.
3. The seller gets a better tax deal as it‚Äôs paid over time, not a lump sum.
4. They get an annuity and you can even afford to pay a bit of a premium over time.

Before you become the great laundry negotiator, check out what we have to say about making great deals (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/5-must-have-processes-for-highly-effective-deal-making/?mc_cid=78fc85fd06&mc_eid=UNIQID) . You want to make things attractive for the seller and realistic for both of you.

Go get sudsy.

** Closing Deals and Making $
------------------------------------------------------------

I call this email:
‚ÄúWhy You Should Believe Anything We Have to Say?‚Äù

We hate the braggadocious nature of emails and humanity these days.

We don‚Äôt have all the answers, sorry.

Full transparency, we‚Äôve made a Tonka truck ton of mistakes.

And I have a feeling we will have quite a few more in our lives, so with that disclaimer here‚Äôs what we do know and why.


Codie‚Äôs Background:
Summary Investing, $, Emerging Markets Repeat

I‚Äôm a reformed journalist, turned institutional investor to now a Partner at Entourage Effect Capital, a private equity firm w/ $200MM in assets in the emerging asset class of cannabis. I left a multi-billion business I built up in Latin America to take advantage of this green emerging sector.

I‚Äôve always worked at the intersection of media, marketing and money, finding contrarian ways to invest.

I played in institutional investing land at SSGA (w/ trillions under management), learned about active investing and alternatives at Goldman Sachs and was at the forefront of the ETF business with Vanguard.

I‚Äôve led global teams in all asset classes, negotiated JV's, bought and sold businesses, sat on boards, lost money, made money, and gotten a few degrees.

But the most fascinating part of all of it, as a former journalist, I saw the inside of how investment firms acquire wealth through M&A and business acquisition. And it‚Äôs not nearly as complex for us all to repeat as most say.


Ryan‚Äôs Background:
Summary Real Estate, Sales, Entrepreneur. Repeat.

I‚Äôve lived a few lives. I started out graduating in the shadows of 9/11. No jobs, no opportunities anywhere. So I did something I‚Äôve repeated many a time, I chose myself. I went and became a rep for Cutco Knives, quickly becoming a top 10 manager with 100 people selling underneath me.

After that I wanted to continue leading and teaching so I went and became a teacher. You all know what teachers make. It ain‚Äôt a lot. Although my early success allowed me to spend time on a passion I was hungry to continue to earn.

So I moved to real estate and quickly became a leader, then an owner, then an owner and investor in multiple real estate brokerages. This was where my interest in acquiring stakes and businesses blossomed.

It‚Äôs what‚Äôs led me to writing quite a few books (a few bestsellers which is candidly a terrible way to make money but a great way to increase your deal flow and network), closing $1 Billion+ in acquisitions and traveling around the world teaching others how to do it. I have no ego in this, I sold knives door to door to get my start.

The theme you‚Äôll see from both of us is we weren‚Äôt handed anything, and you don‚Äôt need to be either to become the 1.6% of Americans who are OWNERS not employees.

Half of you already know you belong and are just here looking for the tactics, the other half are questioning yourselves, so for you, remember: you are meant to be here.
* Effort + Curiosity + Execution + Command = Success  (Aka ECEC, which I say in my head like easy easy :)).

We‚Äôll give you the command of knowledge you need, the tactics, tools, templates, models and contracts, you the effort and curiosity. With that, in the next 90 days, you can ink a deal under your belt.

Maintenance is ALWAYS Easier than Growth

Ryan says it best, it‚Äôs much easier to continue momentum than to start it.

Some people can go from 0 to 1 like Peter Thiel talks about. They can go from negative revenue aka spending on a business to profits‚Ä¶ exponential growth. But those first $1,000, $10,000, $100,000 + dollars are incredibly difficult.
* That is why 96% of startups fail within 10 years, and the average entrepreneur only earns $42K. Growth is expensive and it is hard.

We‚Äôd prefer to draft off of someone else‚Äôs momentum. How many businesses do you know start and immediately day one give the entrepreneur $100k? We‚Äôve certainly never built one. They may eventually amass much more than that but to start? Not likely.

When you buy a small profitable business, you can literally close a deal with a business you buy and using leverage and seller financing pay yourself day one.

How?

‚ÄúIf you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.‚Äù

Yours Unconventionally,

Boring Business Brief, sponsored by Contrarian Thinking
Business buyers taking action
New WoW Deal Tracker from our communities: Work in Progress!


** Your Due Diligence Checklist for Buying a Small Biz
------------------------------------------------------------
In 5 min or less: Fear holds you back from your goals. Finding the perfect deal takes guts...and the right questions. Overcome the fear with due diligence. Preparation makes smoother transactions.


** So... About Last Night
------------------------------------------------------------
We changed the name of our newsletter to ""Boring Business Brief."" Sorry we forgot to mention it.

Who knew monotony was so alluring?


** Fear is a motherf@#ker!
------------------------------------------------------------
Fear will stop someone dead in their tracks. Fear is the reason most people won‚Äôt hit their goals. Whether it‚Äôs personal, health, business or financial goals, people fall short all of the time because it‚Äôs scary to do the thing other people don‚Äôt have the guts to do.

Surrounding yourself with a community of like-minded people (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=6948d2f19e&mc_eid=UNIQID) , rather than your typical naysayer friends, is probably the fastest path to overcoming this fear.

Meanwhile, we‚Äôve got some pointers for due diligence to help take some of the jitters out of your 7-figure business purchase.


** The art of the 'perfect' deal
------------------------------------------------------------
I notice most people fall into one of two camps on this. The first type charges in too fast without asking the right questions. (Not sure who would have done that? It's me, hi.)

The second type talks forever about what they are going to do. Then they get ready to get ready. They stay busy looking at deals, but they just never find the right one.

The right deal exists. They're just scared as shit. Fear is normal, but you get to choose whether you allow it to freeze you in your tracks, or you turn it into action.

You can find a reason to kill every deal, or you can find a way to make it work.

Some deals you should walk away from, some you should run away from. Some will be easy slam dunks. But most will land somewhere in the middle. How you handle the process of due diligence and ask the right questions will determine the strength of the deals you do.


** Let's assume you overcome the fear
------------------------------------------------------------
So, you've decided to take the plunge and purchase a small business. Congratulations! This is an exciting move that comes with its own set of challenges. It also requires a great deal of due diligence on your part.

It pays to ask a lot of questions up front to make sure you're getting the most out of your hard-earned money. To get you started, here are some questions you should consider asking before you make any commitments.

Get the full list (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/your-due-diligence-checklist-for-buying-a-small-biz/?mc_cid=6948d2f19e&mc_eid=UNIQID) on our website!


** Financial
------------------------------------------------------------

* What was the gross revenue over the past 3 years?
* What is the current cash flow situation?
* Are there any debts that will have to be assumed as part of the sale?
* Is there an audit trail showing accurate financials?


** Assets, inventory and equipment
------------------------------------------------------------
* Are all the assets and inventory included in the asking price?
* Are there any assets that need to be replaced soon after closing?
* If you could add one new piece of equipment or asset to grow the business what would your next purchase be?


** Team
------------------------------------------------------------
* How much do employees earn on average and how often are they paid (weekly, bi-weekly)?
* Who are the 3 most important people on the team and why?
* How compliant are employees with laws and regulations?


** Transition plan
------------------------------------------------------------
* Will I receive training from existing owners prior to taking over operations so I can learn first-hand how things work in practice and not just in theory?
* Are all employees on a contract or are they 'at will'?
* Are they aware of a potential sale? Would they be willing to stay on?
* Has any legal advice been sought in regard to intellectual property, customer information protection, etc.?


** Business operations
------------------------------------------------------------
* What are the core processes required to run the business?
* Are those processes documented?


** Customer retention and feedback
------------------------------------------------------------
* What feedback has come from customers?
* Where do most of your current clients come from?
* What is the average customer lifetime value?


** Legal
------------------------------------------------------------
* Are there any pending legal actions against the company?
* Have all licenses necessary for operations been obtained and maintained properly up until now?
* Does this business have contracts with other businesses (customers and/or suppliers) that may need to be renegotiated when ownership changes hands?
* Does this business have patents, trademarks or copyrights registered under its name which will transfer over with ownership change hands (if applicable)?


** Technology
------------------------------------------------------------
* Is online payment processing accepted?
* Is the current website secure from cyber attacks and hacking attempts?
* Are there any backups or redundancies in place in case of a system failure or data breach?
* Has an IT professional been keeping up with tech maintenance (patch updates, etc.) regularly?


** Growth
------------------------------------------------------------
* What digital marketing efforts are already established?
* Can SEO efforts increase organic search results?
* Does the website design meet industry standards?
* Should the social media presence increase?

Obviously, this is not an exhaustive list. Every business has its own nuances, so some of these may not be required for each business. And some businesses may require categories we haven't even discussed here.

The goal of these questions is to get you thinking about how to de-risk the purchase of a small, profitable business with a thorough due diligence process. See more due diligence questions on our website.


** Preparation pays
------------------------------------------------------------

Purchasing a small business can seem overwhelming at first, but asking questions like these can help ensure that you know exactly what you're getting yourself into.

Plus, taking your time on the research can help make sure everything is in order before you close the deal. Having answers ready ahead of time about things like financials, liabilities and operations ensures smoother negotiations and transactions.

With enough research and preparation ‚Äî as well as some serious dedication ‚Äî you can overcome your fears and become a successful small business owner sooner than you think!

** First 3 steps: How and why to buy a business?
------------------------------------------------------------


** How do you know an economist has a sense of humor?
------------------------------------------------------------

He uses decimal points. #nerdjokes

The joke means this...no one f*cking knows anything.

Any human who is self-delusional enough to think they know what the future is going to hold down to the penny, is an instant write-off. ""I think"" are two of the most dangerous words to ever have been said. It's even worse to have people believe ""I think"" means ""will happen."" They most assuredly do not.

If this most recent beginning of a recession taught me anything, it confirmed my belief that even those on high do not know their a$$es from their elbows. Metaphorically speaking, of course.

We saw Chamath Paliapatiya, a billionaire and self-proclaimed ‚ÄúKing of Spacs,‚Äù forced to close 2 of his 3 special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) unsuccessfully. He lost himself and his investors tens of millions to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.

We saw Andreesson Horowitz launch tokens and NFT investments faster than Elon posts Twitter memes. Spoiler: a majority lost money and a few may even be quasi-illegal in their execution with the tokens they utilized (IMHO).

We saw an entire cadre of the world's smartest people bamboozled by the likes of FTX, Celsius, and 372 of the other crypto platforms. I made that number up, but that feels good.

Smart humans exist. But they are far from foolproof. Truly ‚Äì the bigger you get, the harder you fall.

I remember working as an underling at Goldman Sachs in 2008, and then-CEO Lloyd Blankfein came to speak to us. We all said what we did, and I explained my group at the time was ‚Äúthird-party private equity distribution‚Äù or ‚Äúfund distribution.‚Äù

His response: ‚ÄúWhat does that group do?‚Äù Sigh.

My CEO a few companies back told me, ‚ÄùInvestments will never be raised over the internet from strangers.‚Äù I could feel myself thinking, ‚ÄúI hate it here.‚Äù Alas, he was and is a billionaire, and I am still not.

What is the lesson to learn here?


** Net worth scoreboards are not crystal balls.
------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe you can relate. Eight years ago, I hated what I did, worked 65-70+ hours a week, was a slave to my paycheck, and in the opposite of a fairy tale relationship. I wasn't even in charge of my day-to-day, much less my life.

Despite years of schooling, lots of hard work, and a pretty sparkly life from the outside, I was unhappy...to put it in a PG wrapper. But it‚Äôs funny how fast life can pivot.

Today, the story is quite different. I hit that magical (albeit ever-changing) financial freedom number. I own interests in 25+ small businesses, love what I do, and have a husband I adore (99.9% of the time, wink).

It's ok if you are the first version of me.

It's ok to be lost, confused, scared, broke, fat and depressed.

What is not ok?

Staying there.


** Time is money so I‚Äôll get straight to it‚Ä¶
------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to learn how to buy a small business and create your own financial freedom, today will be the best day to start.

We are raising the price of the Small Biz Buyers Course soon, so save $500 by enrolling today. (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/courses/buying-a-small-business/?mc_cid=cd6da64406&mc_eid=UNIQID)


** Take control of your own future.
------------------------------------------------------------

Your future self is sitting just on the other side of fear, waiting for you to show up. So what changed for me? What might be helpful to change for you?

If you‚Äôre ready to do the hard things, then you gotta do the smart things. The single smartest thing I did? Become a dealmaker.

I learned what it meant to be a dealmaker. I began to think like a dealmaker instead of a rule-taker. I started investing in cash-flowing businesses. Not sexy start-ups, but boring businesses.

So, for those of you who think you want to do the same, here‚Äôs my path and how I‚Äôd do it again. It is not the path, it is a path. Freedom can be found down many roads. I took this road to dealmaker.


** Step 1: Foundational opportunity
------------------------------------------------------------

I started scouring the news looking for the best sector, the best entry point, the number one market. But something larger emerged. A realization that opportunities were all around. In fact, in the U.S., as of 2020, there were:
* 2.5 million small businesses ($1-5 million in revenue) for sale
* 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day
* 19% of those owned a small biz
* Only 1 in 11 would sell within 12 months of being listed

That left 91% of businesses for sale on the market ‚Äî with motivated sellers ‚Äî for more than a year. So, if an opportunity arises, how do you make sure you are set up to take advantage of it?


** Step 2: Deal clarity
------------------------------------------------------------

First, I asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat do I really want?‚Äù
Answer: I want to work when I want, where I want, and on what I want, while earning what I need.

Problem: I'm not smart enough to create the next Tesla, Bitcoin, FB, etc., and I had no cool start-up idea.

Solution: I can model (aka do finance and investing) like a MFer and I'm pretty good at DD (aka due diligence) and underwriting companies. Maybe I should just buy a boring cash-flowing biz to offset my income?

I picked up a pen and wrote this down:

Nothing like a little visualization to get things going.

If you want to become a dealmaker too, you could take similar steps in determining what we refer to as your ‚ÄúDeal Box.‚Äù Essentially, we want you to narrow down the size and types of deals that make sense for you to look at, so you don‚Äôt get bogged down in deals that won‚Äôt get you where you want to go.

Consider what size deals you should be doing. How big of a company would you need to buy to more than replace your W-2 income? I always suggest buying a company that has 3X your income as profit. That way you have enough to do three things:
1. Pay back any debt used to buy the company
2. Pay an operator to run the day-to-day, so you aren't buying yourself another jobby-job
3. Pay yourself more than your current salary to provide the vision and growth plan

Consider where you can add value. What skill set do you bring to the table? Maybe it‚Äôs finance like me or sales like Ryan. Maybe it‚Äôs marketing like some of our mastermind members. Maybe you‚Äôre super organized and you are great at creating the systems and processes that were just never written down. Maybe you‚Äôre the tech genius that‚Äôs going to automate that shit (https://contrarianthinking.co/11-ways-to-do-more-work-in-less-time-with-ai/?mc_cid=cd6da64406&mc_eid=UNIQID) ! Find deals that need your magic touch to grow.

Narrow the location or biz type in the beginning, so you can become a market expert quickly, and you‚Äôve got yourself a little deal box. Now, let‚Äôs go find the deals that fit in the box.


** Step 3: Origination, aka finding deals
------------------------------------------------------------

As we mentioned in the intro, there is no shortage of businesses listed for sale. And you could certainly scour the internet looking for deals already listed on the market. In fact, you can check out our article on 130+ places to find businesses to buy (https://contrarianthinking.co/130-boring-businesses-i-love-to-invest-in/?mc_cid=cd6da64406&mc_eid=UNIQID) .
If you want to compete with every other biz buying human on the planet and likely pay a little more than you have to, then the listing sites are a decent place. If you‚Äôre a little more unconventional, like us, you might turn to your network and find the unlisted deals.

Many are unlisted simply because the seller doesn‚Äôt even know they have a saleable asset. They were just going to fade out and let the business turn to dust. When you run a small business for 25-30 years, most people just start to think about it as their job. They don‚Äôt realize that having hundreds of past clients, a well known name, word-of-mouth advertising and a couple of employees could actually be worth something.

Pick your poison for this part. It‚Äôs like any other lead generation or networking ‚Äì it comes down to how many conversations you have with the right people. In this case, it could be anyone who knows a business owner.

Take to the streets. Head to Twitter. Reach out to local business brokers and tell them what you‚Äôre looking for in case a deal comes up. Head to the local networking meetings, or just to the local country club. Let everyone know what you‚Äôre looking for.

If you want to learn the next three steps, make sure you are subscribed to our newsletter. Or, to get all the secrets, sign up for our business buying course (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/courses/buying-a-small-business/?mc_cid=cd6da64406&mc_eid=UNIQID) that takes you through all 10 steps.

(https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=march-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=6a0af69bba&mc_eid=UNIQID)


** 6 businesses with amazingly low failure rates
------------------------------------------------------------


** The odds are not in your favor
------------------------------------------------------------

Are you sick of playing entrepreneurial Russian roulette? Tired of the fear of failure looming over your head?

Well have no fear, my fellow risk-averse friends, because there are businesses out there that actually have a decent chance of surviving the turbulent world of small business ownership. And lucky for you, I‚Äôm here to dish out details on six of them.

If you are thinking of starting a business but worried about the risk of failure, you're not being irrational.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20% of small businesses fail within the first year, 50% within five years, and two-thirds within ten years.

Those are not great odds. But the good news is that certain businesses have a much lower failure rate. There is no such thing as businesses that never fail, but you can certainly improve your chances.


** Stack the deck by investing in one of these
------------------------------------------------------------

Today, we'll explore six types of businesses with low failure rates ‚Äì backed by data. Interestingly enough, you will notice there is a combination of brick-and-mortar, service and real estate based businesses on this list.

Whether you are starting a small business or buying an existing business, these successful small businesses are great places to start when becoming a business owner.


** 1. Laundromats
------------------------------------------------------------

That's right, folks. If you're looking to become small business owners with a high success rate and low overhead, laundromats are the way to go.

Not only are they recession-proof, but they also provide an essential service that's always in demand. Plus, who doesn't love the smell of fresh laundry?

But wait, there's more.

Laundromats are also incredibly easy to manage. You don't need a large staff or a ton of experience to run a successful laundromat. Just make sure your machines are in good working order, and your customers are happy.

Think about it: everyone needs to do laundry. If you can provide a clean, convenient and affordable place to do it, you'll have customers for life.

And with the rise of technology, managing a laundromat has never been easier. You can set up keyless entry, tracking systems and automated contracts to make the process smoother and more efficient.

So, what's the catch?

Well, there isn't one, really. Laundromats are a tried and true business model that's been around for decades. And costs of operation tend to be low, allowing for good potential for profitability.

With the right business model and marketing strategy, laundromats can be a successful and lucrative venture.


** 2. Rental property businesses
------------------------------------------------------------

Listen up, real estate lovers! If you're looking for a solid investment with a kick-ass 85.3% success rate, then rental properties are where it's at.

And the icing on the cake? You don't even have to deal with being a landlord. Just hire a property manager to handle the headaches and let you focus on the fun stuff, like spending all that sweet rental income on exotic vacations and fancy cars.

Plus, with the added benefit of generating monthly cash flow through rental income, you can sit back and watch your investment grow. And let's not forget about the tax benefits associated with real estate investing, including 1031 exchanges, depreciation and amortization.

So, if you're looking to build long-term wealth, investing in rental properties might just be your ticket to financial freedom.


** 3. Self-storage facilities
------------------------------------------------------------

Self-storage facilities may not be the sexiest investment, but they certainly get the job done with a 92% success rate.

Thanks to technology, it's now possible to run these facilities remotely with keyless entry, tracking systems, security systems and automated contracts. Which means you can sit back and watch the cash flow in while sipping your margarita on the beach.

But what makes self-storage even more attractive is the value-add component.

Unlike other asset classes in real estate, self-storage facilities offer the opportunity to improve and upgrade existing facilities. From solar panels to eco-friendly materials, there are plenty of ways to enhance the value of your investment.

So if you're looking for a low-risk business venture that's both scalable and profitable, self-storage is definitely worth considering.
https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=march-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=6a0af69bba&mc_eid=UNIQID


** 4. Transportation businesses
------------------------------------------------------------

Well, well, well. Looks like the pandemic has changed more than just our work-life balance and our pants size. Online shopping is here to stay, and transportation businesses are reaping the benefits with a success rate of 76.4%

According to Advisor Smith, last-mile delivery has become a crucial part of our economy, and transportation and logistics are in high demand.

That means it's the perfect time to hop on the bandwagon and invest in a short-distance trucking company, or even start a side hustle driving for Uber on the weekends.

With minimal startup costs and a low risk factor, transportation is a no-brainer for those looking to make some extra cash. So, get behind the wheel and hit the gas ‚Äì there's money to be made.


** 5. Vending machine businesses
------------------------------------------------------------

Let's talk about vending machines, shall we?

I know what you're thinking: ""Who even uses vending machines anymore?"" But hold your snarky comments for a second, because these things are still going strong with a success rate of over 90%. That's right, people still love the convenience of grabbing a snack or drink on the go.

What's even better is that you don't need a ton of cash to get started. In fact, you can start with just one vending machine and scale up from there.

And there's plenty to learn about logistics, pricing, margins and managing a few contractors or running it by yourself. It's the perfect starter business for the hustlers out there who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty.

But don't think vending machines are all about junk food and soda. Oh no, my friend. These days, you can vend anything from healthy snacks to travel necessities. Yes, you heard me right. You can provide convenience to people on the go while making a tidy profit for yourself.

And if you're not sold on the idea of starting a vending machine business from scratch, you can always add it to one of your existing businesses.

Our friend Mike owns a 30-unit hotel that they recently converted into short-term rental units with a significant overhaul. And now they're adding vending machines to sell items like phone chargers and beach towels to their guests.

See? The possibilities are endless.


** 6. Senior care centers
------------------------------------------------------------

We all know that we're getting older and crankier every day, but senior care centers offer a fantastic investment opportunity with surprisingly low failure rates.

With the US population aging rapidly, the demand for senior care centers is on the rise, and the government is even chipping in to help subsidize the cost.

Investing in senior care centers can be a bit more complex than the other businesses on this list, as you'll need to navigate zoning regulations and work with healthcare professionals to ensure you're providing top-notch care to your residents.

But if you're up for the challenge, senior care centers can be a rewarding and profitable investment. Plus, it's nice to know that you're making a positive impact on people's lives as they enter their golden years.

So there you have it, 6 businesses with low failure rates that you might want to consider investing in.

Of course, investing in any business comes with its own set of risks and challenges, but with a little research (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/your-due-diligence-checklist-for-buying-a-small-biz/?mc_cid=6a0af69bba&mc_eid=UNIQID) and a lot of hustle, you might just find yourself on the path to financial freedom.

Now, go out there and make some money, my friends!

Business buyers taking action


** Don't DIY the biz you buy
------------------------------------------------------------


** You can't do it alone
------------------------------------------------------------

They say that you have to roll your sleeves up, do the work, risk it all, or you‚Äôll never make it.

But the footnote they forget to mention is that often, these violent delights have violent ends ‚Äì especially in small business buying.

Because the truth is that you‚Äôre in uncharted territory. And the industry you just bought into? Probably not your sweet spot.

And this, my friend, is exactly why you need an operator.


** The brains and the brawn
------------------------------------------------------------

Will you be the brains, or will you be the brawn? The choice is yours.

When you‚Äôre the brains, you‚Äôre the mastermind behind the whole operation.

You decide how things are going to go down week over week. You pore over spreadsheets and obsess over weekly dashboards.

You make sure you hire the right people, so your business is full of all-star employees who provide a level of customer service that even your grandma would write home about.

But you stay TF out of the weeds. You‚Äôre not managing the business day-to-day, answering phones, or stepping foot in the office. Nope, not in your job description.

This is exactly why you ‚Äì the owner ‚Äì will hire the business equivalent of your next of kin. Your brawn. Your operator.

Your operator is the person your people will report to. They‚Äôre the top dog who will make sure the trains run on time.

Choose wrong, and your vision of passive cash flow will turn into spending all day in the office and staying up all night just to keep things afloat.

And what can I say? Not the vibe.


** What to look for in an operator
------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a behavior assessment. It‚Äôs not as intrusive as a background check, but adding this to the final round of your interview process might be just as revealing.

Looking into someone‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses from an objective source before hiring them is an almost no-brainer. Some of the tests I lean on are Myers-Briggs, DiSC, the Kolbe A Index, or StrengthsFinder.

Red flags we look for when screening operators during the interview process:
* Significant employment gaps or industry hopping
* Their references either don‚Äôt exist or are a little sus
* Weird body language (i.e. no direct eye contact, slumped over in the chair)
* Difficulty describing their past experience or it sounds too good to be true
* Unclear when speaking or goes on long tangents
* Tardiness or taking too long to reply or get back to you
* Not being transparent about past mistakes or showing a lack of ownership


** Invaluable experience
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the kinda thing they can‚Äôt teach you in school.

Depending on what kind of small business you now own, you‚Äôll want some level of diversity in their past experience. Look for a variety of business sizes, revenue streams, team structures and business models.

You‚Äôll also want someone who‚Äôs seen the not-so-hot days of your industry, so they can lead your business through the slower seasons without flinching.


** An obsession for logistics
------------------------------------------------------------

Trust‚Äîyou‚Äôll thank me later. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a skill that comes from industry experience.

You‚Äôre looking for the kid who used to align their toy cars in neat rows. You‚Äôre looking for the adult who can‚Äôt sleep if the dashboard isn‚Äôt updated.

You want somebody whose idea of a good time is running a hella tight ship.


** Impeccable people skills
------------------------------------------------------------

You‚Äôre basically looking for a street-smart, small business version of Ted Lasso. Hiring someone who has a long fuse in the people department will be one of the smartest decisions you will make.

Remember, this person will be managing your team and your customers on an hourly basis. If their people skills suck, you‚Äôll get stuck with a phone call saying ‚Äúwell, that escalated quickly‚Äù and you‚Äôll have to step in.

Trust me, there are better things to do with your time than dealing with a noisy customer.


** A natural culture fit
------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike some things in business, culture fit just can‚Äôt be taught. When you‚Äôre hiring an operator, you‚Äôll want someone who can show up and fit right into your company culture on day 1.

If it‚Äôs not there, it‚Äôs not there, and if you notice it‚Äôs not jiving by day 30, it might be time to reassess or hire someone else.

Don‚Äôt forget to reverse it and assess if their values fit in with yours, too.


** Aligned goals and aspirations
------------------------------------------------------------

Does your candidate want a certain salary or span of control? Have plans to start a family in a year? What do their career goals look like for the next year? Three years? Five years?

You should approach hiring an operator like it‚Äôs a long-term investment in your business, because it totally is. You want an operator who is committed to your business for years, because the hiring and training process can get expensive.


** Hire slow, promote from within
------------------------------------------------------------

My last bit of advice here is to take your time during the interview process and focus on finding the right person for the job. Don‚Äôt rush through it just to get the role filled as quickly as possible.

I know it feels like you‚Äôre wasting time, but you‚Äôll be wasting some serious money if you have complaining customers, an operations meltdown, or have to retrain someone else when your new operator quits or gets fired.

One Q we get in our mastermind (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=318fb4d134&mc_eid=UNIQID) is where to find a high-quality operator. One of the best places to look: inside the business you just bought.

We‚Äôve found that some of the best operators are currently already employees.

This is because they‚Äôre already familiar with how the biz runs, the systems, the processes, the vendors‚Äîheck, they may even be on a first name basis with some of your best, most loyal customers.

You‚Äôll still need to screen and interview them as if they were brand new to your business, but also spend some time asking them what gaps they see. If they could fix anything in the business, what would they work on first?

Their answer might just get them the job, or at least act as great feedback to add to your to-do list (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/what-to-do-in-your-first-90-days/?mc_cid=318fb4d134&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

Business buyers taking action


** How to buy a business while working a full-time job
------------------------------------------------------------

One question we get asked a lot is how to go about buying a business while you‚Äôre still working a full-time job. I mean, if you‚Äôre first starting out, there‚Äôs a lot to learn.

You probably want to know what your financing options are. You probably want to make sure you‚Äôre finding the right fit for your portfolio based on your goals.

And if I had to guess, you also probably don‚Äôt have a lot of time to invest in learning how to do it.

What can I say? You strike me as the kind of person who wants a solid ROI on their investment on day one.

If any of this sounds like you, keep reading. Today we‚Äôre outlining some really simple ways to buy a business while you‚Äôre still working somewhere else.

Let‚Äôs get to it.


** 1. Avoid startups and other shiny, ‚Äútoo-good-to-be-true‚Äù opportunities
------------------------------------------------------------

I know it probably seems really sexy to invest in startups that promise to be the next Uber or Tesla. But most of the time, you won‚Äôt see cash flowing into your pocket anytime soon.

In some cases, it may even take years for your dividends to equate to truly passive income.

That‚Äôs why we love boring businesses. They‚Äôre unassuming, low-stress and will help you see a return on your investment from the very first day you‚Äôre the owner.

They‚Äôre also a lot less risky than a company that‚Äôs just starting out. My rule for business buying is to invest in somewhere that has:
* been in business for at least 3 years
* a squeaky clean profit and loss statement
* tax returns available to view
* standard operating procedures in place
* an owner who is actually interested in selling their business

Curious about how to navigate buying your first (or maybe your next) business? We created a small business buying course (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/courses/buying-a-small-business/?mc_cid=b742b481e7&mc_eid=UNIQID) that will walk you through everything you need to know.

And if you‚Äôre really serious about creating more passive income, we‚Äôve also got a mastermind course (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=b742b481e7&mc_eid=UNIQID) with playbooks on exactly how to do it.


** 2. Find businesses with low upfront costs that will cashflow on day one
------------------------------------------------------------

This is another popular philosophy we have, so I want to walk you through an example.

Have you ever thought about the profit margins versus the startup costs of a vending machine (yes‚Ä¶I‚Äôm talking about those glowing snack boxes you see outside the DMV).

My friend Quinn brings in over $20k of revenue every single month from his vending machine business, and he‚Äôs only putting in about 10 hours a week to do it.

Part of the reason this business has such high margins is because the costs to manage it are relatively low. And the best part? The cost to get started is pretty affordable if you ask me.

You really only need a vending machine (~$500-$3k, depending on where you buy it) and a credit card reader ($250).

You‚Äôll also need to hire someone strong who can move it to the location you‚Äôd like (~$100), and buy snacks to stock it up ($250 when you buy in bulk at a warehouse store like Costco).

You don‚Äôt even have to pay for real estate to place your vending machine. In most cases, a property owner will let you place your machine on their turf at little or no cost to you.

That means that you can get started with cash flowing on day one, with just $2.1k upfront.


** 3. Look for opportunities that give ownership + equity
------------------------------------------------------------

Before you look into buying a business, you‚Äôll need to decide how involved in the business you want to be. Do you want to be the person working in it day-to-day?

Once you get a better idea of what you want that working dynamic to look like, you‚Äôll want to find business opportunities that will give you full ownership of the company, as well as equity.

A few business ideas that may sound boring, but will equal passive income for you, are things like laundromats, car washes and even waste management services.

Businesses like these will allow you to hire an operator (i.e. someone who manages the day-to-day logistics in your business) and a team of employees who will perform the majority of the work to run the business for you.

Another benefit of finding an operator (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/dont-diy-the-small-biz-you-buy/?mc_cid=b742b481e7&mc_eid=UNIQID) is that they are likely an expert in their field and will know the best way to run the business. Compare that to the months (or even years) it would take you to figure out the best way to do things yourself, and an operator is a total game changer.


** Creating cash flow is a great use of vacation days
------------------------------------------------------------

Doing your due diligence (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/your-due-diligence-checklist-for-buying-a-small-biz/?mc_cid=b742b481e7&mc_eid=UNIQID) to figure out if a deal is right for you can take a lot of time, especially if this is your first time around.

You may need to meet with the previous owner, a lawyer, your bank, etc. and those things take time. Plus, if you want to research the industry, location and other info about your deal, you‚Äôll need to plan for a lot of late-night Google sessions.

Whether it‚Äôs taking a few hours to meet up with someone, or giving yourself time to really dive deep into the details, you will need to come up with time to devote to your deal during the typical 9-to-5 workday.

One thing we recommend, especially for new dealmakers or experienced dealmakers who are buying in an industry they‚Äôre unfamiliar with, is to save up vacation days or PTO so you can give yourself ample time for research.

If you want to get the kind of support you‚Äôll need to be totally confident in your deal‚Ä¶well, that‚Äôs exactly why we‚Äôre here.

Our business buying course (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/courses/buying-a-small-business/?mc_cid=b742b481e7&mc_eid=UNIQID) outlines exactly what you‚Äôll need to do to get started (perfect for you if you‚Äôre new to the world of dealmaking).

And if you‚Äôre ready to really dive in and do the dang thing, then our mastermind (https://bit.ly/3rBJvhC?mc_cid=b742b481e7&mc_eid=UNIQID) is perfect for you. You‚Äôll get accountability from a community, a weekly forum to ask your questions, and access to our playbooks for buying various types of boring businesses.

Because, yes, you could spend hours and hours scrolling the internet trying to figure out how to do it, or losing sleep at night wondering if your deal is a good one. But why would you want to?

We‚Äôll help you make the right investing decisions to meet your goals (and make money at it, too).

Business buyers taking action


** Everything you need to know about
seller financing
------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to buying a small business, especially your first one, coming up with the cash can be the biggest hurdle to overcome. Seller financing may be your key to making it happen.

Small business seller financing is a type of financing where, instead of getting a loan from a bank or other financial institution, you get the financing directly from the seller.

It allows you to negotiate flexible payment terms and gives you more control over your investment while avoiding a large down payment.

This is what I‚Äôm talking about when I say you can buy a business with other people‚Äôs money by financing your purchase with future sales.

But how exactly does seller financing work?

Basically, the seller gives you a loan to purchase their business instead of expecting full payment up front.

This gives cash-strapped buyers an opportunity to purchase a small business that they otherwise couldn't afford, and allows both parties to benefit from the transaction in an equitable way.

Sound too good to be true? Good instincts. There are risks involved, so make sure you understand the ins and outs of seller financing before deciding if it's right for your situation.


** Structuring a seller financing agreement
------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding how to structure a seller financing agreement is essential. You‚Äôll want to discuss each of these factors with the seller before drawing up an agreement:
* Down payment: How much are you putting down at closing for the business?
* Interest rate: Annual rate of interest that will be paid to the seller on the note. Note whether this is a fixed or variable rate.
* Term: How long you have to pay back the loan with a payment schedule.
* Security or guarantees: What sort of guarantees does the seller have that they will get their money?


** Benefits and risks of using seller financing
------------------------------------------------------------

We'll start with the bright side.


** Benefits:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Faster closing: With seller financing, you can skip all the red tape and waiting around for a bank loan officer to approve your application. You can get to the good stuff faster, like owning your dream business.

2. Cheaper closing costs: Who wants to pay a bunch of fees and appraisal costs? Not me, and I bet not you either. With seller financing, you can avoid all those extra costs traditional lenders like to charge.

3. Flexible down payment: You can negotiate with the seller for a more flexible down payment without worrying about strict bank or government-required minimums. It's like having a personal finance genie at your disposal.

4. Easier financing: Can't get approved for a loan? No problemo. With owner financing, you don't have to subject yourself to the strict loan approval procedures that traditional lenders use. However, the seller will likely run a credit check on you, so make sure you've been paying your bills on time.


** Potential risks:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Personal guarantees: One of the major risks associated with seller financing is that it often involves personal guarantees. This could make you liable for debts incurred during the transaction as well as any future loans related to the business.
Personally, I would push for the seller‚Äôs only recourse for failed payment to be to take back the business. This de-risks the deal for both you and the seller. In a worst-case scenario, the seller gets to keep whatever they collected and step back in to right the ship. They can even sell the business to a new buyer if they want.

2. Higher interest rates: Buyer beware ‚Äì many sellers opt for high interest rates in order to increase their return from a sale and make it more lucrative.
I would try to frame the interest rate based on what the seller believes they could earn elsewhere rather than against competitive SBA rates. If you pitch this correctly, you can persuade the seller of the benefits of offering seller financing. Otherwise, they need to find a place to invest the cash to generate a similar return after the sale.

3. Higher overall cost: Keep the phrase ‚ÄúMy price, your terms or your price, my terms.‚Äù in mind. You may end up paying a little more for the business, but you get to make the purchase without putting down all of your cash.


** Tips for negotiating terms
------------------------------------------------------------

So, let‚Äôs talk about terms. When negotiating seller financing terms, it's important to create a win-win situation for both parties. You want the best possible deal that limits your personal financial risk while still being attractive to the seller.

Obviously, most sellers would like as much money as possible from the deal. But you would be surprised at how many other factors come into play here. Knowing which levers to pull can land you much better terms, while also making the seller feel secure in the deal.

Start by opening up a dialogue to understand the seller‚Äôs ideal outcome. Here are a few questions I like to ask:
* What‚Äôs most important to you in selling the business? (Success of the business after the sale, clients being well taken care of, employees having jobs, cash received immediately, or total cash received over the next few years?)
* How do I make this a win for you?
* If I paid you the total amount today to buy the business, what would you do with the cash?
* Have you talked with your accountant about how to handle the taxes from a big lump sum payment?
* What rate of return do you think you could get with cash in a safe investment vehicle right now if you were to invest it yourself?

Then, research best practices and seek expert guidance to gain an understanding of the legal and tax requirements associated with the transaction. Better yet, hire a lawyer.

When you present facts rather than speculations, you put yourself in a stronger position and increase your chance of getting the best deal possible.

Learning how to negotiate the best terms for your seller financing deal can save you significant time, money and effort in the long run.


** Sourcing funds to finance a seller-financed deal
------------------------------------------------------------
When considering how to source the down payment for your seller-financed small business purchase, you‚Äôve got options. Perhaps the most traditional option is to use funds from personal or retirement accounts.

But there are also other sources to consider, like outside private funding and investments, partnerships, friends and family members. Loan officers and financial advisors can offer expertise and help evaluate your specific situation.

It all comes down to finding the best balance of risk and reward. Getting creative with down payment sources can be one way to increase profitability while lowering the overall costs associated with the purchase.

If you find a motivated seller and really turn on the charm, you may even negotiate the down payment to nothing ‚Äì like this 22-year-old who bought a car wash that now cashflows $7.4k a month (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfwtCSDH_w&mc_cid=5a283b37d2&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

With seller financing, you‚Äôre basically buying a business using other people‚Äôs money and little to no money down. What‚Äôs not to love?

Of course, there are risks involved with this type of transaction, but nothing you can‚Äôt handle with due diligence and skillful negotiation.

Business buyers taking action


** Gird your LOIs
------------------------------------------------------------

You‚Äôve got a few bookmarks on businesses you‚Äôve been interested in buying, and now you‚Äôre ready to approach the owner.

Not so fast.

Before you can get the full financial picture of a business you want to buy, you‚Äôve got to get your hands on the goods‚Äîthe financials and the records.

But the seller isn‚Äôt going to just let you walk through the door with them. You have to ask for permission via an attorney with a letter of intent (LOI for short). And maybe an NDA.

We have a system in place for when we‚Äôre making moves on a business. After doing millions of dollars in deals, these aren‚Äôt that complicated.

But before we go on, it has to be said‚Ä¶we‚Äôre not attorneys, and we‚Äôre not giving legal advice here.

We are simply sharing what works for us.


** WTF is an LOI?
------------------------------------------------------------

A letter of intent, or LOI, is the first documented touchpoint and non-binding agreement between all parties that will be involved in a business deal.

When buying a small business, the LOI is how we get the information we need to make an informed decision and complete our due diligence.

Once this paperwork is approved by the current owner, we get access to non-public information like the seller‚Äôs financials, company records, and customer information. Then we can verify accuracy and make sure this is a good deal to pursue.

Submitting an LOI is one of the first major steps on the path to acquiring a small business. And it's a critical one, but so is every other piece of the puzzle.

Next week I'm hosting a free, live masterclass to show you my proven, holistic approach to acquiring boring businesses that cashflow.

If you want to see start-to-finish how this all works, you don't want to miss this. Space is truly limited to the first 5,000 people (over 14k people signed up last time). You can save your spot here. (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/business-buying-masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=april-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=597243a9f0&mc_eid=UNIQID)


** A smart LOI sets the deal up for success
------------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve done a whole lot of these‚Ä¶and yes, made our fair share of fumbles. Here‚Äôs what we find works best.


** Know our ideal payment terms
------------------------------------------------------------
Figuring out the financing before sending the LOI makes the initial search process much smoother‚Äîespecially if we‚Äôre working with a broker.

It helps to go in knowing what elements of our deal are non-negotiable and where we‚Äôve got wiggle room.

Our fave way to fund a deal is through seller financing (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/struggling-to-come-up-with-the-cash-to-buy-a-small-business/?mc_cid=597243a9f0&mc_eid=UNIQID) , but we‚Äôve also got the option to apply for a bank loan or an SBA loan (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/how-to-get-an-sba-loan-to-buy-a-business/?mc_cid=597243a9f0&mc_eid=UNIQID) .


** Avoid TMI
------------------------------------------------------------
The point of an LOI is to get the basic information we‚Äôll need to make an informed decision during our due diligence process.

But we also leave room to get curious during our conversation with the seller. We typically ask upfront for:
* A list of what is up for grabs in the sale (i.e. assets, equipment)
* Clarification on the deal timeline (especially around key dates)
* Payment terms (i.e. cash, assets, equity)
* Written consent of confidentiality for both parties until the deal is completed


** Seek exclusivity
------------------------------------------------------------

What we don‚Äôt want is for our seller to have the option to approach or negotiate with multiple buyers at once, so they can pull together their best offer. Letting the seller shop our deal with other parties will cost us money.

So, we include verbiage in our LOI that protects our negotiation period for a set amount of time. That gives us time to take the next step and get under the hood of the business we‚Äôre interested in buying.

This is typically not possible during the NDA stage, and it may cost some money to lock it down for this period. So the devil is in the details on how long of an exclusivity period we get.

We often ask for 30 days.


** Communicate through a single point of contact
------------------------------------------------------------

We also avoid using casual communication channels (like text messages) when discussing the deal with our seller or with our dealmaking team (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/deal-making-team/?mc_cid=597243a9f0&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

If we have a conversation in-person or on the phone, we also make sure to take notes and promptly send a follow-up email that documents what was shared and discussed by both parties.


** F Yes or F No
------------------------------------------------------------

Strong communication is the #1 indicator to the seller that we know our sh*t , so this one carries some weight.

If we come across as half-in half-out, wishy-washy, or otherwise semi-uninterested in the deal, we‚Äôre likely going to annoy the seller.

We respond promptly with email replies, follow up in a timely manner, and always communicate important status updates with the seller.


** DIY is not the move here
------------------------------------------------------------
Let me tell you about my friend Ken. He thought that he could save a few bucks, download the first LOI template that he found on Google, and send it over to his seller as a placeholder until he had a little more time to pull together the real deal.

The only problem was that, without knowing it, Ken committed to his deal without doing his due diligence‚Ä¶all because one teeny tiny microscopic clause wasn‚Äôt tweaked, which turned the LOI into a legally binding document.

Say it with me‚Ä¶

Ouch.

Since Ken thought that it would be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and ‚Äúless expensive‚Äù to hold off on hiring an attorney, he didn‚Äôt have someone who went to law school look over his LOI before he pressed send.

Please, I‚Äôm begging you. Do not do this.

Templates are (sometimes) great, but one of the most invaluable assets you‚Äôll have in your biz buying journey is an attorney.

Preferably one who:
* Is well versed in small biz M&A
* Has experience with the size of your deal and industry
* Can scrub your LOI for any legal jargon that actually equals a legally binding document (amongst other important things)
* Can give you actual legal advice (since, again, we can‚Äôt)


** 7 questions to find your biz buying attorney
------------------------------------------------------------
When you're on the hunt for an attorney to draft an LOI for buying a small and profitable business, it's like finding Waldo in a sea of striped shirts.

So, let's spice things up with seven sizzling questions you can ask to find your legal superhero.
1. Have you ever dipped your toes in the LOI pool for small businesses, or are you still testing the waters? Experience is the name of the game, and you'll want an attorney who knows how to swim with the sharks.
2. Got any adoring fans who will sing your praises? A good attorney will have a fan club of satisfied clients who can vouch for their ability to work their legal magic on deals like yours.
3. You wouldn't happen to be an encyclopedia of knowledge about the industry I'm diving into, would you? It's a big plus if your attorney knows the ins and outs of the industry you're entering, because they can help you navigate the minefield of regulations like a pro.
4. What's your secret recipe for an LOI that has my back? A skilled attorney can cook up an LOI with all the right ingredients to keep your interests safe and sound, without giving away the secret sauce.
5. How do you win friends and influence sellers (and their attorneys)? Your attorney should be a smooth operator when it comes to negotiations, making sure you come out on top without ruffling too many feathers.
6. Speaking of cash money, how do you like to be compensated for your legal wizardry? Is it a flat fee, an hourly rate, or some other mystical concoction? No one likes surprises when it comes to the bill, so better to get the money talk out of the way early.
7. And lastly, how's your texting game? Good communication is essential, so make sure your attorney won't ghost you and will keep you in the loop as the deal unfolds.

If you can‚Äôt afford an attorney, it‚Äôs worth holding off on buying this (or any) biz until you can. Or wrap some of that cash into the expected sale cost. The investment is worth it.

It‚Äôs also a good idea to network with other small business buyers and service providers (like accountants, attorneys, and brokers) who can help you during the process.

There are many local small business bureaus, Facebook groups, and networking websites specifically for small business buyers and investors.

Not to shamelessly plug our own gig, but the free masterclass we're hosting next week is also a great resource if you‚Äôve got specific questions about the biz buying process. You can reserve your seat here.

‚úîÔ∏è Going big by going small

‚úîÔ∏è 4 biggest problems in doing deals

‚úîÔ∏è Find me a MFing deal

‚úîÔ∏è Find me an operator

On February 15, 2020, we were all about to become survivors. A
pandemic and a series of trials over the coming years would
forever alter our lives.

If only we knew then what we know now. What different decisions
would we have made?

We survived:

* shutdowns
* business closures
* market crashes
* riots
* political upheavals
* massive layoffs

Not to mention advancements in technology and world events at a
rate few expected.

February 15 is the day we started Contrarian Thinking. Now, there
are more than 252,000 of you reading this email.

We had an inkling that the world would need some common sense,
some critical thinking. But we had no idea that now, in the year
2023, our core tenets of freedom and ownership would ring so
true.

But that‚Äôs the thing about missions‚Äîthey ripple. They tend to
stretch beyond what one could imagine. And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs
happening.

‚Äã

************************
Going big by going small
************************

We saw what was happening in the world and realized we all needed
one thing: ownership. We needed to revert to personal
sovereignty.

So, we set out to create owners. We aimed to create 1 million
financially free humans and 100,000 small business owners so that
our neighborhoods wouldn‚Äôt be littered with corporate billboards‚Ä¶

‚Äã
...but instead be filled with stores whose owners, I don‚Äôt know,
actually lived there.

We realized that as the world got more volatile, it would be
critical to have more humans with skin in the game‚Äîwho actually
have a stake in building, not tearing down.

We wanted to push back on the reality that:

* Most hardware stores, grocery stores and car washes are owned
by conglomerates, not locals. They don't care about your
neighborhood.
* The government would prefer to collect taxes from 500 S&P 500
Corporations than from 5,000,000 small business owners.
* 60% of all businesses that closed during Covid never reopened
again.
* 16.5% of prime age males are without paid work. During the
Great Depression, it was only 14.5%.
* The median SMB holds 27 days of cash on hand‚Äîand that is not
enough.

Amongst all this tragedy there was, as there always is,
opportunity. A lot of it.

The opportunity to buy these small businesses, to continue the
ownership legacy of the Baby Boomers. What if the world needs you
to go small? And to own‚Ä¶(because I love these things)...

‚Äã
So, we built out an entire series of tools to help people buy,
sell, and build small everyday ‚Äúboring‚Äù businesses.

‚Äã

*********************************
4 biggest problems in doing deals
*********************************

* Knowing how to invest, buy and build small businesses
* Raising the money or finding capital to do the deal
* Finding businesses willing to sell that are worth buying
* Having an operator to run the company so you can do the next
deal

We set out to solve each of these problems.

Find me a MFing deal
********************

‚ÄúCodie, where are the f*cking deals???‚Äù

This is hands-down the most common question I get. Candidly, it
annoys me. Can I say that? Whatever.

Usually, I‚Äôd say people think they can‚Äôt find deals when what
they really don‚Äôt have is enough knowledge on dealmaking and
business buying in general.

Said less nicely, you can‚Äôt find a deal because you don‚Äôt deserve
one yet.

Deals come when you really know what makes a good deal vs. bad
deal, what is a good deal for you, the best way to finance each
different type of deal, how to structure it, how to negotiate for
it, etc.

It's what we call the 10 steps of the deal journey.

‚Äã
But let‚Äôs say you actually know you want to buy a carwash in St.
Louis, Missouri, and just need to find one. Well now WE GOT YOU,
FAM.

Find me an operator

Our next problem to tackle goes something like this. You work a 9
to 5 but you want out, or you want more income.

Yet, ain‚Äôt nobody got time to run a landscaping company and write
code for Twitter. Especially these days.

Thus you rub your magic little lamp and ask the genie, ‚ÄúIf I had
someone who could operate a $2 million landscaping company for
me, we could both cashflow and get equity. Please, Genie, find me
an operator.‚Äù

Alright, homie. We‚Äôre working on that.

View this email in your browser (https://mailchi.mp/c1ee199d77a7/how-to-buy-a-business-while-working-a-full-time-job-6134606?e=0ddfc7c603)
Business buyers taking action

If you‚Äôre new to dealmaking, you may not realize yet that it‚Äôs not a one-person show. We‚Äôve explored and executed hundreds of deals in our time, and we‚Äôve found it‚Äôs best to have at least a few team members lined up.

Today, we‚Äôll break down the absolutely essential list of people you should have on your side as you buy a business. These people will help you execute the deal from the early exploration and due diligence stages to negotiations and closing.


** Choose your team wisely
------------------------------------------------------------

What we‚Äôre walking through today is essentially how you‚Äôll build your dealmaking board of directors from the ground up.

You likely already know (or even have a relationship with) some of these types of people. If you don‚Äôt, lean heavily on your network. Chances are you know someone who knows someone who knows someone who can help you.

Avoid hitting up Google‚Ä¶this is not a situation where you want to wind up with a rando.

If there‚Äôs one general practice we can offer when it comes to approaching a deal, it‚Äôs that simpler is better. Make sure your team is on board with this philosophy as well, so you don‚Äôt get caught up in a bunch of jargon that slows down your process.

You should also consider adding some sort of escape clause as a part of your deal that allows you to cut ties with any of your dealmaking team members during the process if things aren‚Äôt panning out.

Take it from our past experience ‚Äì this is a necessary safeguard if you‚Äôve never worked with your specialist before.


** Pick an attorney with M&A chops
------------------------------------------------------------

Your attorney‚Äôs job will be to help you draft, craft and deliver all of the legal documents during the due diligence and negotiation process.

This could include things like drafting or revising your letter of intent (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/what-to-include-in-a-letter-of-intent-2/?mc_cid=7f6cf3c96e&mc_eid=UNIQID) , guiding you through how to structure your deal, or even clearing up the terms of the deal.

Make sure that your attorney isn‚Äôt a generalist. This is not the time to test out a lawyer who has never facilitated an M&A deal before.

It may seem like the same attorney who helped you get divorced can help you buy a small business, but these are two very different skill sets, and we don‚Äôt recommend mixing them up.

One thing to look out for along the way: make sure your attorney isn‚Äôt overcomplicating the deal terms. If it‚Äôs your first time trying to buy a business, it‚Äôs okay to keep the overall structure simple. (In fact, we‚Äôd argue that this is preferred!)


** Find accountants you can count on
------------------------------------------------------------
In dealmaking, your accountant will be the one to sniff out all the numbers that the small business owner has presented to you during the due diligence process (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/your-due-diligence-checklist-for-buying-a-small-biz/?mc_cid=7f6cf3c96e&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

They will be a critical part of your business buying journey because they‚Äôll be the ones diving deep into the financials to figure out if the numbers are real or not.

Your accountant will likely need some financials from the current owner upfront to help you during the due diligence process. We always recommend starting out with:
* Financials (i.e. annual revenue and monthly recurring revenue)
* Cash flow (i.e. profit/loss, profit margin and income streams)
* Expenses (i.e. monthly and yearly expenses on equipment, labor and maintenance)
* Assets (i.e. equipment, real estate and machinery)

You can also ask for more numbers and information later, once you‚Äôre in the formal due diligence process.


** Line up banker or local SBA contact
------------------------------------------------------------
This is the person who will help you through the financing portion (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/more-ways-to-buy-a-business-with-no-money/?mc_cid=7f6cf3c96e&mc_eid=UNIQID) of your deal.

If you‚Äôll be working with a banker, make sure your credit score is great and that the existing company has substantial assets that will be a part of the deal. Otherwise, you run the risk of the deal not going through and having to find other ways to finance your business acquisition.

If you‚Äôre getting an SBA loan, you may not actually need a local banker. Instead, you‚Äôll work directly with an SBA agent to help finance your loan. You can call your local SBA office and talk to a representative to see what the terms of your SBA loan could look like.


** Other helpful additions for your dealmaking team
------------------------------------------------------------


** A business broker
------------------------------------------------------------

A broker is not always necessary to find a deal. But they can be a helpful addition to the team if you‚Äôre slammed with multiple deals that are up in the air.

Bonus points if they‚Äôre a specialist in your industry or have worked on a deal like yours before.

Just make sure that you‚Äôre either bringing them on from the start or not at all. Business brokers don‚Äôt really need to be around during the middle of a deal unless they are a vetted and trusted source for you.


** An operator
------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre not planning on keeping the current CEO in their position after you buy the business, go ahead and put some feelers out for who your operator could be (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/dont-diy-the-small-biz-you-buy/?mc_cid=7f6cf3c96e&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

If the seller and current CEO is planning on retiring, for example, you‚Äôll want to have an operator in mind.

I mean‚Ä¶you could operate it yourself, too, but the whole point of buying an existing business is so you don‚Äôt have to be the one actually running it day-to-day.


** A business partner
------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre planning on purchasing this business with a business partner, we‚Äôd recommend bringing them in as early as possible. Nobody wants to sign their name on an asset as big as a business without having been involved in the early process.

It may also slow down the negotiation process if you are going back and forth with a partner or trying to get the deal terms right with the seller and a business partner mid-deal.

Make sure that you and your business partner are on the same page as far as the types of deals you‚Äôre looking for, and communicate consistently during the due diligence process so you can stay aligned.

Business buyers taking action

A recent post in our private community for the Unconventional Acquisitions Mastermind (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind?mc_cid=d60b5ba215&mc_eid=UNIQID) brought to light a discussion of when and how to use EBITDA vs SDE.

And, for that matter, what the hell these metrics actually mean.

The post ignited a firestorm of comments & conversations, racking up dozens of likes in mere hours within our exclusive private community.

If it‚Äôs coming up in this group of business-buying badasses, then this topic is worth tackling head-on here.

As you know, we‚Äôre all about cutting through the BS, so buckle up, my friends. Today, we'll embark on a no-holds-barred journey to explore the key differences between EBITDA and SDE when it comes to valuing and buying a small business.


**
------------------------------------------------------------


** EBITDA: the slick, suited-up Wall Street darling
------------------------------------------------------------

First, let's talk about EBITDA: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

It's the slick, suited-up Wall Street darling that makes you feel like a financial genius just by saying it. But what does it really mean?

In simple terms, EBITDA measures a company's profitability. It strips away layers like interest expenses, taxes on earnings, depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets.

What you're left with is a ""bottom line"" that reveals the raw, unadulterated profitability of a company.

But like any Wall Street darling, EBITDA has its dark side. While it's great for making your numbers look pretty, it doesn't account for debt levels or long-term liabilities. And that's a big deal when you're deciding whether to bet on a company.

Moreover, EBITDA is vulnerable to manipulation through adjustments and accounting standards that can obscure the real picture.

So, use EBITDA wisely, my friends. Don't be seduced by its slick appearance and forget its deficiencies.


**
------------------------------------------------------------


** SDE: the street-smart hustler
------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's turn our attention to SDE, or seller's discretionary earnings.

The International Business Brokers Association (IBBA) defines SDE as ""the earnings of a business prior to income taxes, depreciation, amortization, interest, non-operating income and expenses, nonrecurring income and expenses, and one owner's entire compensation (including benefits and any non-business or personal expenses paid by the business).""

To put it simply, SDE is like EBITDA's scrappy, street-smart hustler cousin. It's a measure of a company's earning potential, so in that sense, it's not that dissimilar from EBITDA.

The main difference is that SDE includes the owner's salary and compensation when the owner is operating the business.

In contrast, EBITDA would need to include compensation for an operator.

Here's the thing: many of the smaller businesses that use SDE don't have a ton of reasons for depreciation of assets or interest on debt. They're often smaller, simpler businesses with an owner-operator at the helm.

And that's where SDE shines‚Äîit's the perfect metric for valuing these scrappy, nimble enterprises.


** Unleashing SDE's true potential
------------------------------------------------------------
To determine a business's SDE, you'll need to consider various ""add-backs."" Think of these as the secret sauce that unleashes SDE's true potential.

Jeffrey Baxter of MidStreet Mergers and Acquisitions has a fantastic article that breaks down the different types of commonly used add-backs (https://www.midstreet.com/blog/sellers-discretionary-earnings-explained-with-examples?mc_cid=d60b5ba215&mc_eid=UNIQID) in determining SDE.

Here's a quick summary:
1. Standard add-backs: Salary for one full-time owner, payroll taxes and EBITDA add-backs
2. Discretionary add-backs: Personal travel, personal or family fuel, club dues, owner's health insurance, personal mobile phones, and charitable donations
3. Non-recurring add-backs: One-time expenses like upgrades, tech, or other extraordinary costs
4. Non-operating add-backs: Income or expenses unrelated to core operations of the business, like gains or losses from investments

Mastering the art of add-backs can make a massive difference when you're trying to make sense of a business's SDE. It helps you paint a more accurate picture of the company's true earnings potential, which is crucial when you're deciding whether to buy.


** Cashflow is king
------------------------------------------------------------
Let's not forget one crucial point when it comes to EBITDA and SDE:

Neither metric guarantees cash in your pocket.

While depreciation might save you money on taxes and help grow your wealth in assets, it won't exactly line your pockets with spendable green.

And if you're using other people's money to finance your acquisition, you'll need that profit margin to cover your debt.

Remember, the goal is to build a sustainable business that generates real cashflow, not just impressive numbers on paper.

So, when you're valuing a business and calculating EBITDA or SDE, always keep in mind that these figures represent potential earnings and cash flow, but they're not a direct measure of the cold, hard cash you'll be able to spend as the business owner.

Stay focused on what truly matters: building a profitable, cash-generating business that aligns with your financial goals and aspirations.


** The final showdown
------------------------------------------------------------

So, who's the winner in this cage match between EBITDA and SDE? Like any good fight, it's not that simple. Both metrics have their strengths and weaknesses, and the one you should use depends on the specific business and your unique circumstances.

If you're looking at a larger, more complex business with multiple layers of financial entanglement, EBITD can help you cut through the noise and focus on the company's profitability.

On the other hand, if you're sizing up a smaller, simpler business with an owner-operator running the show, SDE might be your go-to metric. It's tailored for these types of businesses and can give you a clearer understanding of the company's potential for generating cash flow.

So, there you have it: the ultimate showdown between EBITDA and SDE is essentially a draw. It's not about picking your favorite metric and sticking with it. It's about knowing which metric to trust and when.

Use this knowledge to make smarter decisions when valuing and buying businesses, and you'll be well on your way to becoming an unstoppable force in the wild world of business valuation.

Business buyers taking action

With 30 million small businesses in the United States, 600k biting the dust, and 1 million shiny new ones emerging each year, why the heck would you even consider building your own from scratch?

And where the actual hell do you find a small business to buy? Is there a secret speakeasy you need an invite to? Do you need to cozy up to the cutthroat sharks from Shark Tank?

Relax. The answer is no. All you need is to know where to dig and be ready to flex those muscles. But first‚Ä¶


** Know what you‚Äôre looking for
------------------------------------------------------------

Diving headfirst into the M&A world, it's crucial to zero in on the right types of sellers. You know, the ones you can swoop in and save.

Keep an eye out for potential sellers with these characteristics‚Äîeven if their business doesn‚Äôt have a blinking neon ""for sale"" sign on it.
* Baby boomers
* Fatigued or nearing retirement
* Eager to dissolve the family biz
* Facing declining health
* Considering a move or relocation
* Lacking transition plans or successors

Though not foolproof, these characteristics can help you spot small business owners who may be more inclined to sell.

You may have heard us talk about the SOWS method:

Armed with these factors, you're ready to hit the streets.


** Search business listings, then stop in for a visit
------------------------------------------------------------
BizBuySell (https://www.bizbuysell.com/?mc_cid=d20c7a3f63&mc_eid=UNIQID) is like Craigslist for business listings for an area or industry. Think Zillow but for business listings instead of real estate.

If you‚Äôre a newbie to your industry and need a crash course on pricing or how to structure a deal, start here.

But fair warning: BizBuySell is teeming with traffic. So, the deals can be pricier, and there's an army of buyers elbowing their way through the listings (more competition).

Google is also your BFF, especially if you‚Äôre hunting for a business in a specific industry (like a laundromat or car wash) in your area. Just do a basic search for the type of business you‚Äôre interested in, and see what pops up close to your location.

If you can, dig up more dirt on the owner, the business, and the location. Your research here can serve as a basic sniff test to help you figure out if this is the type of establishment you‚Äôd like to learn more about.

If a business passes your initial screening, set up a time to pop in when you‚Äôre in the area or when the owner is in. Finding a small business really can be as simple as finding a good candidate, then hitting them up on the phone (yes, the old-school way) or shooting them an email to connect. If they have an Instagram or Facebook page, you can even shoot them a DM.

Even if you‚Äôre greener than green when it comes to buying a biz, any exposure and interaction you can have during this stage will set you up for future success.

Focus on picking up the phone and chatting with 5 local business owners a month until you feel a little more confident. The more conversations you have, the better idea you'll get of the types of businesses that are a good fit for you.


** Level up with BizScout
------------------------------------------------------------
Ever wanted to scream in frustration while scouring the internet for off-market businesses?

BizScout.io (https://www.bizscout.io/?mc_cid=d20c7a3f63&mc_eid=UNIQID) isn't just another platform; it's the cheat code to level up your business acquisition game and make the whole process a cakewalk.

So much so... we bought the company (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/dont-diy-the-small-biz-you-buy/?mc_cid=d20c7a3f63&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

Instead of wasting hours on traditional marketplaces, BizScout takes your preferences and generates a customized list of off-market businesses that match your criteria.

All you need is a few keywords, and it'll generate a customized list of businesses that may be right for you. No more endless trolling for deals!

It's the perfect tool to help you navigate the world of small business acquisitions more effectively.


** Attend conferences or meetups
------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre focusing on a particular industry, you‚Äôll save a ton of effort by figuring out where the small business owners in that space tend to congregate. Want to know the best bet to get ‚Äòem all in one place?

A conference.

I mean‚Ä¶imagine waltzing into a room with thousands of other laundromat owners who already know the ropes (and who may even be interested in selling their small business).

Carve out a few hours to stop in, schmooze with people, and save yourself weeks hunched over your computer, scrolling through listings like a mad scientist.


** Tap into your network
------------------------------------------------------------

Social media is another goldmine for finding local businesses to buy. Chances are, one of your Facebook friends or Instagram followers knows someone with the kind of business you‚Äôre searching for (or they know someone who knows someone).

You may find that the small business owners your network connects you with aren‚Äôt quite ready to sell yet. That‚Äôs totally okay.

The key to leveraging your network is at least getting the conversation going with potential sellers. That way, you become their #1 pick should they decide to sell one day. Plus, they may know other small business owners who are interested in selling sooner.


** Finding off-market deals
------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, let's get to the juicy part. The story goes that a mastermind member (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=d20c7a3f63&mc_eid=UNIQID) stumbled upon a hidden gem while getting their morning caffeine fix. In a casual conversation with the caf√© owner, they discovered the owner was on the brink of retiring and hadn't even considered listing the business for sale yet. With some smooth talking and a well-timed business card exchange, our mastermind member walked away with a piping hot off-market deal ‚Äì and an extra shot of espresso in their latte.

That's the beauty of off-market deals; they're often hiding in plain sight, just waiting for someone with the right blend of curiosity and persistence to uncover them. The best part? The competition is virtually nonexistent, giving you the upper hand when negotiating and closing the deal.

Unrealistic or too good to be true?

There are more just like that one. Chris, another one of our members (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=d20c7a3f63&mc_eid=UNIQID) , just came on our Mastermind call as a guest and broke down his most recently closed plumbing deal. He called up an electrical contractor and a local business owner he knew. He let his business acquaintance know his plans for putting a handful of deals together to scale and exit.

Chris explained that he was looking to buy a plumbing company and wanted a partner that understood the home services industry. A partnership was born. The electrical contractor even knew exactly which plumber to contact. He made the call, and the deal just closed a few weeks ago.

So, keep your eyes peeled and your ears open. You never know when you'll stumble upon your very own off-market treasure. It all comes down to having enough conversations about your business buying goals.


** Wrapping it up
------------------------------------------------------------

Finding a small business to buy doesn‚Äôt have to feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. With a little creativity, persistence, and a whole lot of networking, you can uncover some amazing off-market deals just waiting to be scooped up.

Remember, the key is to know what you're looking for, be open to exploring different avenues, and never underestimate the power of a well-timed conversation.

Happy hunting!

Business buyers taking action

Good afternoon, In our business-buying community, most members aren‚Äôt driven by a passion for buying a business.

They‚Äôre really driven by their 9-5. To free themselves from its power. To escape it altogether. To build something more meaningful. To make that W2 money work harder for them. To start rolling the ball on that magic generational wealth.

Relatable? This one‚Äôs for you.

** Breaking Free from the 9-to-5 Grind: A Guide to Small Business Acquisition
------------------------------------------------------------

The mundane routine of the corporate world: endless meetings, constant emails, soul-crushing commute. Building someone else‚Äôs wealth and trading your time for money. All while struggling to create your own financial freedom and time freedom.

Are you tired of it yet?

Well, my friend, it's time to take a leap of faith and explore the world of small biz ownership.


** Jessica: Don't fall for startup traps
------------------------------------------------------------

The journey to entrepreneurial success is fraught with challenges, mishaps, and the occasional reality check. For every success story, countless people have left their jobs only to fall flat on their faces.

Take Jessica, for example.

Jessica quit her job to start a tech startup, only to realize she had no idea how to build a business from scratch. The startup fizzled out, and Jessica crawled back to her former employer with her tail between her legs. Jessica‚Äôs story is typical when talking with people who want to make the leap.

But it shouldn‚Äôt discourage you. Startups may have a so-so track record for success, but you have another option: small biz acquisition. It allows you to leverage an existing customer base, brand, and operational system.

But how do you buy a business without abandoning the 9-5 ship?

Here are 4 ways to make the leap to business ownership and your dreams of freedom.


** Natalie: Your digital entry-point
------------------------------------------------------------

To get your feet wet, you may need to buy a business that's less hands-on. Buying a blog that aligns with your interests can be a low-risk entry point to small business ownership.

Use your expertise and passion to monetize valuable content through affiliate marketing, sponsorships, or digital products. You may not make a fortune overnight, but you can create a solid foundation to build upon while transitioning from your W-2 job.

Like Natalie.

She was one of the initial members of our Unconventional Acquisitions Mastermind when we launched in 2020. Natalie initially wanted to buy a brick-and-mortar business but realized she'd be paying more than she was willing to risk in NYC.

Instead, she worked on building relationships with brands and affiliate partners, increasing their social media presence, and slowly replacing her income over the next year.

The popularity of our mastermind (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=b374092e52&mc_eid=UNIQID) has exploded this year, and because we‚Äôre committed to providing the best possible experience for our members, we will begin waitlisting people on May 25th. So, if you‚Äôve been thinking about joining, make sure you do it before the cut-off.

If you‚Äôre ready to join, you can sign up here (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=b374092e52&mc_eid=UNIQID) or schedule a free consult to discuss your options.


** Paul and Mary: Easy wins
------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for a slightly more hands-on approach? Buying an established business with a successful track record can provide a steady income stream while you build upon its current systems and operations.

Consider businesses that are relatively easy to operate:
* Vending machines
* Ice vending
* A laundromat with new equipment and card readers

These businesses require minimal time and effort, giving you the flexibility to pursue other interests or side hustles.

Meet Paul and Mary. Paul is a W-2 employee with some flexibility in his schedule. Mary owns and operates a business that takes much of her time.

Their goal was more revenue sources with little day-to-day commitment. So they purchased two laundromats, one with real estate included. They upgraded the equipment with card readers. They hired someone to stop by daily for cleaning.

Paul showcased the robot and iPad for customer check-ins, FaceTime support, refunds, and machine resets via his phone app. They revamped the business and integrated technology. Easy win.


** Bret: Big-league player
------------------------------------------------------------

Ready to take a bigger swing and aim for a more significant acquisition? Purchasing an established business with a steady track record of profits can provide a substantial income boost and the opportunity for growth.

Look for businesses that align with your interests and skills, and do your due diligence to ensure the company has a solid foundation and growth potential. Consider partnering with an operator who brings complementary skills, allowing you to divide and conquer the business operations.

Take Bret, for example.

He was tired of working long hours at a job that didn't create long-term wealth. Bret started looking at some smaller deals but quickly realized that they would not allow him to transition out of his current job. He needed cash flow left over after expenses and debt service to replace his current income.

So Bret purchased a Solar and Battery Installation Company for $4.75 Million using a combination of SBA lending, some seller financing, and personal funds. Within two weeks of closing on the business, Bret was already transitioning out of his W-2 job.


** Renan: Swing for the fences
------------------------------------------------------------

Feeling ambitious and ready to swing for the fences? Purchasing a larger company with a full-time operator in place can provide an immediate income boost and an opportunity for significant growth.

Look for companies with a proven track record of success and a loyal customer base. Be prepared to invest time and effort in due diligence and negotiations.

Have you heard of Renan?

Renan was sick of long hours at a job he didn't love. He took a chance and purchased a successful remediation company with talented employees in place. He negotiated an $8 Million purchase (one of our larger deals), 100% seller financed.

Renan also partnered with an operator to step in and run the business. Now he spends limited time on this business and has already moved on to a second acquisition. Meanwhile, this company profits $2 Million annually.


** How to not fall flat
------------------------------------------------------------

We had a group member who made a risky investment in a frozen yogurt franchise without consulting us.

It's a cautionary tale for small business acquisitions.

While they can offer a strategic approach to entrepreneurship, they aren't a shortcut to success.

Hard work and facing challenges are inevitable, but you can achieve the freedom and fulfillment you crave with determination.

So, take the leap of faith, and good luck!

Business buyers taking action

Good afternoon. Picture this:

You're sitting at a hipster caf√©, listening to a genre of music you don‚Äôt know the name of, sipping an artisanal espresso.

Can you smell it?

Then, your mind starts drifting to the tantalizing world of small business ownership. You can almost taste it.


** In 5 minutes or less:
------------------------------------------------------------
* The dreamer to achiever pipeline
* Your (lack of) experience is your secret weapon
* The 4 assets you didn‚Äôt know you have
* Vision to reality exercise
* The honor of a fresh start

What if acquiring a small biz gave you the freedom you've always craved...?

But then, the inner (and outer) critics rear their ugly heads.

""You've never owned a business before,"" they scoff. ""What makes you think you'll succeed?""

Buckle up, my rebellious dreamer, because we're shattering the myth that business ownership is reserved for the privileged few with an MBA and silver spoon.

Does this resonate with you?

Take the next step.

Next week, I'm hosting a live, free masterclass breaking down the exact 10 steps I've used to purchase 20+ cashflowing businesses. No acquisition experience is necessary.

Spots are limited, so reserve your seat now (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/cashflow-masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=may-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=501f457dc4&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

But today‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs prove you have what it takes.


** Dreamer to achiever pipeline
------------------------------------------------------------

Forget the conventional wisdom that says you need decades of entrepreneurial experience to make it in SMB acquisitions.

In fact, your lack of previous business ownership might just be your secret weapon. We‚Äôve built an entire mastermind community based on this premise.

Let‚Äôs unleash your potential by flipping the script on the doubters. We'll explore how your fresh perspective, hunger for success, and unapologetic passion can catapult you to SMB glory.

So, leave the doubters in the dust, take a sip of that bold espresso, and let's embark on a journey that will make those critics eat their words. It's time to show the world what you're made of.


** Your (lack of) experience is your secret weapon
------------------------------------------------------------

No one came out of the womb a CEO. Actually, the best business owners you know likely had entire careers‚Äô worth of experiences before ever owning a business.

The logic is simple:

Prior business ownership is not a prerequisite to owning a business.

It‚Äôs not even necessarily a disadvantage.


** Embrace your unconventional advantage
------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the truth: your lack of previous business ownership experience can actually be a powerful asset.

Why? Because you bring a fresh perspective untainted by the limitations of traditional thinking.

You're not burdened by the ""that's how it's always been done"" mentality. Your rebellious spirit allows you to challenge the status quo, think outside the box, and see opportunities where others see roadblocks.


** Tap into your arsenal of skills
------------------------------------------------------------

You‚Äôre not yet in the business-owning bubble. You‚Äôre not yet hampered by the ‚Äúshould‚Äùs.

So blaze your own trail with your unique abilities.
* You have an unyielding desire to make a difference? Seek small businesses that align with your passions. Whether it's digital innovation, artisanal craftsmanship, sustainable living... Let it propel you.
* You've fostered a network of mavericks? Get their guidance, ask for their support, and bring them with you into your first biz.

* You can turn chaos into order? Use your ability to juggle multiple projects with finesse. Leverage your gift to produce unmatched SOPs. The growth of your first business will thank you.

These skills are the ammunition in your arsenal, ready to be let loose on the battlefield of biz ownership.

Embrace your ability to strategize, adapt, and rally a team. Your unique skill set singles you out for success.


** The 4 assets you didn‚Äôt even know you have
------------------------------------------------------------

As a seasoned professional who has led teams or departments, it's natural to have doubts about your ability to run your own business.

But do you really think your past experiences haven‚Äôt equipped you with valuable entrepreneurial skills?

Time to reframe these 4 business-owning advantages.

‚öíÔ∏èThe resourceful mindset
Running a business requires thinking on your feet and finding creative solutions.

Throughout your career, you‚Äôve likely faced numerous hurdles and obstacles. This has sharpened your adaptability.

Embrace your resourceful nature. Let it guide your acquisitions.

üí™The leadership advantage
Communication, decision-making, and problem-solving are essential for navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship.

You‚Äôve honed these skills in your experience managing teams and departments.

Trust in your ability to lead and inspire others. Trust this gives you a leg up in running a business.

üñºÔ∏èThe big-picture perspective
When making strategic decisions for your business, a big-picture perspective is invaluable.

As a leader, you‚Äôve had to think strategically and consider your organization's broader goals and objectives.

Believe in your ability to analyze market trends, identify opportunities, and make well-informed choices.

üï∏Ô∏èThe relationship web
Connections are a tremendous asset in acquiring and growing a small business.

Your professional journey has allowed you to build a network of connections and relationships.

Leverage your network to seek advice, find potential business opportunities, and form strategic partnerships.


** Vision to reality exercise
------------------------------------------------------------

Don't take our word for it. Prove you have what it takes.

Close your eyes and visualize the SMB empire you want to build.

Envision yourself as the trailblazing owner, making bold decisions and achieving remarkable success.

Now, open your eyes and write down the skills, experiences, and passions that would bring this vision to life.

Next, write a list of your professional achievements and skills you've developed throughout your career.

How much overlap is there between the two lists?

What unique strengths do you bring to the business-owning table?

And what's missing now?


** The honor of a fresh start
------------------------------------------------------------

The path to small business ownership is yours to conquer.

You have a contrarian advantage, armed with fresh perspectives, unconventional skills, and a passion that refuses to be extinguished.

So, take another sip of that bold espresso and embark on this electrifying journey. Embrace your past experiences and leverage your unique strengths.

Unleash your rebellious spirit.

A Contrarian Framework:
-----------------------

----------------
Don‚Äôt be the 85%
----------------

‚Äã85.4% of small business owners wish they‚Äôd started sooner. (

)‚Äã

None wish they‚Äôd read one more book.

None regret not spending $100k on another degree.

None pine for a life with a safe job in a safe industry and a
safe 40 years until the false freedom we call retirement.

Most people never take a real risk in their lives.

But the owners?

They only wish they‚Äôd done it sooner.

If you‚Äôre gonna take the step‚Ä¶

Take it now.

‚Äã

---------------------------------------
How 2 guys became chimney repair MOGULS
---------------------------------------

It‚Äôs 2018 and two ex-Marines, Matt and Billy, work at a chimney
repair company in Roanoke, Virginia.

‚Äã
Need a chimney cap installed, worn mortar repaired, or flue
buildup removed? They‚Äôre your guys.

For a while, things go pretty well‚Ä¶ Until they suddenly don't.

First, paychecks are late. Then they bounce. The guys‚Äô ideas are
tossed in the trash. And to top it off, they're given the boot.

So they stick up two middle fingers, team up with Matt‚Äôs younger
brother Mitchell, and start their own company.

The three founders scrounged together $8,000. Just enough to
cover licenses, uniforms, a van, flyers, and business cards.

With that, Patriot Chimney (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h7redldtq/58hvh7hmnpm0ggb6/aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXRyaW90Y2hpbW5leS5uZXQv
) was born.

‚Äã

Crunching the numbers
---------------------

Repairing chimneys sounds great and all, but how profitable is
the business?

It depends on who‚Äôs running it...

Year 1: Patriot Chimney did ~$21k a month, totaling $212,000 in
gross revenue at 8% net profit.

‚Äã
That‚Äôs about $17k total profit for months of work. Almost enough
to make you think this chimney biz won‚Äôt catch fire.

But remember ‚Äì it's a new company run by three first-time
business owners: we‚Äôre bound to have bottlenecks.

Year 2: Average monthly revenue rose to $45,394, at 38% profit.

‚Äã
Year 3: By 2021, Patriot Chimney grew to a full operation with 3
vans, 5 full-time employees, and a warehouse.

After raising prices from $85 to $250 per inspection, the owners
hit $463,000+ in revenue ‚Äì 30% more than they made in 2020.

‚Äã
Now we need to break down exactly how these guys pulled it off.

‚Äã

------------------------------------
What they did to scale profit by 30%
------------------------------------

1. Division of labor
--------------------

‚ÄùToo many captains sink the ship.‚Äù

I‚Äôve seen too many businesses where everyone wants to row in a
different direction. Especially in companies with 2+ founders.

But you can get around this with the right division of labor.

Since Matt and Billy were the ones with industry experience, they
were heavily involved with product and order fulfillment. Their
knowledge base also made them the company's first salesmen.

Mitchell, on the other hand, was the one with a marketing degree,
which made him the designated 'tech' guy.

With a $500 monthly budget, he ran the company's digital
campaign.

He hired an SEO agency to create blog posts 2x a month while he
handled email marketing, social media, and Pay-Per-Click (PPC)
ads himself.

That‚Äôs right. Facebook ads for birds in your chimney. There‚Äôs a
first time for everything on the internet.

‚Äã

2. Building a sales program
---------------------------

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, digital marketing is the #1 cheat code for
successful small businesses.

BUT, there are certain industries that can‚Äôt do away with the
touch of a good old-fashioned salesman.

Patriot Chimney realized it was in one such industry and sprang
for door-to-door sales early on. They got old-school with flyers,
door hangers, and postcards left directly on folks‚Äô porches.

Billy and Matt created a custom sales flowchart complete with
specific instructions on things like ‚Äòhow long to wait before
follow-up‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat % discount to offer‚Äô.

Building out this SOP completely took the guesswork out of their
sales program (increased close rate from 40% to 56.8%), while
consistently feeding leads into their pipeline (increased AOV
from $333 to $508).

‚Äã

3. Rely on systems
------------------

Truth is, systems build a business. Handling everything manually
eventually leads to $$$ slipping through the cracks.

Today, Patriot Chimney uses 11+ tools for its systems alone.

From tracking door-to-door sales to sending follow-up postcards
to asking for reviews‚Ä¶ Most of the business operations happen on
auto-pilot.

Switching to Jobber (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h7redldtq/25h2hoh28r2g34s3/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZXRqb2JiZXIuY29tLw==
) the second year alone made a $200k difference in rev.

‚Äã

‚Äã

--------------------------
How you can replicate this
--------------------------

STEP #1: PICKING A NICHE
------------------------

Home repair is a great space to own a sweaty biz. There‚Äôs one
vital principle to keep in mind: recurring revenue.

‚Äã
When choosing your industry, consider verticals that regularly
get return customers in a fixed timeframe.

* Your concrete company might not need to pay a visit for another
10-15 years.
* Your plumber could come today and still get at least one more
call from you before August.

So how about your chimney service?

Local fire codes recommend homeowners get their chimneys checked
yearly. Which means in a 5-year window (with some expertly-timed
marketing reminders), you get to charge the same customer at
least 3 times.

STEP #2: THE BORING STUFF
-------------------------

In construction-related industries, always factor in licenses,
permits, and insurance. No one wants an electrician who can‚Äôt
prove they know which wire to cut or a tree trimmer with no
insurance.

Chimney biz‚Äôs, though, are a surprisingly grey area.

Your location may or may not require certain certifications. But
for marketing‚Äôs sake‚Ä¶ Get all the training and badges you can.
Make the choice easy for your customer.

Visit your local SBA (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/qdu9vz5p44c7h7redldtq/g3hnh5h3l73nmxfr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2JhLmdvdi9hYm91dC1zYmEvc2JhLWxvY2F0aW9ucw==
) to learn exactly what you need to know about the licensing
body, process, and insurance near you.

STEP #3: REFERRAL PARTNERSHIPS
------------------------------

Strategically partnering with other companies is some low-hanging
revenue fruit.

Patriot Chimney realized chimney leaks usually manifest as roof
leaks. So, what do you do with that?

* You go to the local roofers, and you strike a deal: if a roof
leak ends up a chimney issue, they‚Äôll call you. If a chimney
issue is being a leaky roof, you‚Äôll call them.
* You go to the local chimney suppliers, and you make sure
they‚Äôll send you customers as long as you use their parts.
* You get to know the gutter cleaners, the power washers, and
anyone else who might need to ‚Äúknow a chimney guy.‚Äù And you
become their guy.

Relationships are the 20% of effort that yield 80% of results in
business.

STEP #4: DON‚ÄôT BE THE BEST
--------------------------

Think you need to be the best on the market to succeed in
business?

Noble, but counter-intuitive.

The truth is, you don‚Äôt need to be better than everyone else‚Ä¶ You
just have to be better than the guy selling next door.

Matt and his co-founders knew this, which is why they obsessed on
their competitors‚Äô Yelp reviews. Every negative review for the
competition is a chance to prove why you‚Äôre the better choice.

Don‚Äôt learn from your mistakes.

Learn from someone else‚Äôs first.

Business buyers taking action

Hey there, business buyers!

In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, things are a little wild economically (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/fed-raises-interest-rate-again-but-hints-it-may-pause-due-to-bank-turmoil?mc_cid=f85037cd3f&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

But if you‚Äôre thinking that makes it a bad time to buy a business, we‚Äôd like to politely inform you why that may just be completely backwards.

BizBuySell recently released their quarterly report (https://www.bizbuysell.com/insight-report/?mc_cid=f85037cd3f&mc_eid=UNIQID) . They interviewed hundreds of business brokers from across the United States. And 70% of those industry experts believe that seller financing is a key factor in the current market.

That‚Äôs right. Experts are encouraging seller financing. If that doesn‚Äôt sound like music to your ears, you probably don‚Äôt know enough about seller financing.

Let‚Äôs dive into why it‚Äôs beneficial for buyers and sellers both and how you can actually get your next deal seller financed.

* Why YOU should want it
* Why your SELLER wants it
* How to persuade your seller
* $550k SF deal from our Mastermind


** Why seller financing makes sense in today's market
------------------------------------------------------------

There are two main reasons why seller financing is taking the limelight right now: rising interest rates and limited options for financing overall.


** High interest rates
------------------------------------------------------------

One compelling reason to embrace seller financing is today‚Äôs soaring interest rates.

Traditional lenders (like banks) often charge steep rates, significantly increasing the cost of acquiring a SMB.

By using seller financing, you can avoid these high interest rates. This could save you thousands of dollars in the long run.


** Limited financing options
------------------------------------------------------------

Financing options can be limited, especially for buyers who may not meet the stringent requirements of traditional lenders.

Seller financing offers an alternative solution, providing funding that may not be available through other channels.

In a market where banks tighten access, seller financing opens doors.


** Why YOU should want it
------------------------------------------------------------
Seller financing is one of the best deals you can get in acquisitions.

There are three key reasons.
1. Competitive edge. In a market like this one, you aren‚Äôt the only investor struggling to fund deals.

By embracing seller financing, you gain a competitive edge by accessing funds traditional lenders might not provide.

2. Flexible terms. Banks don‚Äôt leave room for negotiation. Can‚Äôt play by their rules? No funding for you. Seller financing gives you back the power.

You can work directly with the seller to structure repayment schedules, interest rates, and other terms to align with your financial goals and cash flow capabilities. Craft the financing arrangement that suits your needs.

3. Streamlined approval process. When you take the lending institutions out of the equation, you also take out their red tape, bureaucracy, and lengthy approvals.

Seller financing is a more streamlined path. You negotiate terms directly with the seller.


** Why your SELLER wants it
------------------------------------------------------------

One of the main objections we hear from prospective buyers on seller financing: ""Sounds great for me, but no seller would ever agree to this.""

But there are actually many reasons why seller financing is a great deal for the seller, too. Let's go over four of them.


** Attract qualified buyers
------------------------------------------------------------

In some markets, institutional financing options can be hard to come by ‚Äì even for experienced, quality buyers.

The proposition of seller financing makes a deal stand out. The business becomes more attractive, which broadens the pool of potential buyers.

Seller financing actually increases the chance of a successful sale. This is especially important in a world where 80% of owners (https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2017/02/05/these-8-stats-show-why-many-business-owners-cant-sell-when-they-want-to/?sh=6f4d807144bd&mc_cid=f85037cd3f&mc_eid=UNIQID)  that want to sell can't.


** Faster sales and smoother transitions
------------------------------------------------------------

Seller financing can expedite the process, avoiding the delays and uncertainties caused by traditional financing.

The sale is more efficient, and sellers can feel more confident about the transition.


** Potential for higher selling price
------------------------------------------------------------

Offering seller financing can give a seller a bit more leverage in a deal.

Buyers are willing to pay a premium for the added flexibility of seller financing. Since it‚Äôs so attractive to buyers, sellers can justify a higher valuation for the business‚Ä¶ And so, command a higher selling price.


** Potential for tax advantages
------------------------------------------------------------

Most sellers want to reduce their taxes when selling their business, or delay paying these taxes.

An accountant can help the seller learn their specific tax benefits from the business's sale, but seller financing almost always leaves them on top.

Some sellers will be more comfortable with the idea of having a continuous stream of revenue rather than a lump sum. With a lump sum, they‚Äôd need to find a place to invest it to get the same type of consistent return they would with seller financing.


** How to persuade your seller
------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, there are loads of benefits for an owner who offers seller financing. But the objections still bear a kernel of truth: not every seller will be convinced right away.

The success of seller financing comes down to you ‚Äì your persuasion, your rapport with the seller, your trustworthiness.

Here are some tips while selling your seller:

1. Sell the benefits. With seller financing, the tables turn. You must sell yourself and the idea of SF. Clearly communicate the benefits. Paint a vivid picture of the increased marketability, higher selling price, speed, and extra interest.

2. Showcase your capability. If the seller attaches their future finances to you, they deserve to know you‚Äôre not a total schmuck.

Share your track record of success, relevant experience, and skills. Discuss in detail your dedication to the business‚Äô long-term growth. Describe your strategy, and instill confidence in your seller‚Äôs mind.

3. Offer a win-win scenario. A seller is more likely to accept the deal if they understand that it's mutually beneficial.

Highlight the reduced risk of default since the seller retains a vested interest in the business's success. Assure the seller that their financial goals can be met while enabling you, the buyer, to acquire the business on favorable terms.

4. Provide clear, transparent terms. Transparency is key. Outline the terms of the financing arrangement: loan amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, and any collateral or guarantees. Make sure each item is clearly stated.

Be prepared to address concerns and provide reassurance that you will honor your financial obligations. Presenting a well-defined and transparent proposal will alleviate the seller's doubts.


** $550k SF deal from our Mastermind
------------------------------------------------------------

Eric is the perfect example of everything coming together on a seller financing deal.

He keeps it real ‚Äì not all $800k of his renovation biz purchase was paid for on the seller‚Äôs dime. Only about 70% of it.

The other 30% was made up of around 5 different loans, all from different lenders. A true testament to how tangled the red tape of financial institutions can get.

So how did Eric swing a half million+ in a seller‚Äôs note? Let alone with 0% interest??

It all comes down to how he communicated with the seller.

Here‚Äôs what Eric did right:

* He negotiated. The beauty of seller financing lies in its flexibility. Eric took full advantage of this, coming to the negotiation table prepped and ready.

* He made it a win-win. What did Eric need? A fair price for the issues he was about to inherit. What did the seller need? A regular drip of cold, hard cash for his next investment (ideally without a bunch of interest rate math muddying up the numbers).
To both win, Eric got a 0% rate on payment, and the seller got an extra $50k on price.

* He kept the numbers clear and transparent. He reverse-engineered the deal with the owner. If the bottom line was that seller needed $X per month for Y years, then Eric was happy to oblige.

So, my ambitious business buyers, embrace the power of seller financing. Unleash your persuasive prowess and pave your way to financial freedom and entrepreneurial success.

Instead of seeing road blocks in the current market, see opportunity. In the realm of small business acquisitions, where the rules are constantly shifting, seller financing is your secret weapon.

The stage is set for you. Go claim your role.

When fame isn't enough: The unexpected business moves by celebs
to build their empires
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Celebrities used to die with no cash.

They were victims of bad managers, predatory industries, and
fraud. After all, they were supposed to focus on their ‚Äúart‚Äù‚Ä¶ Not
the 100s of millions of dollars in value they created.

Let‚Äôs take Mike Tyson. One of the greatest heavyweight boxers of
all time, he made over $300Million throughout his career. But by
2003? He was filing for bankruptcy.

‚ÄúWell, if I had Oscars, a championship title, or millions of
followers, I‚Äôd be making huge money moves.‚Äù Maybe. Probably not.

Today we‚Äôre covering some of the most lucrative celebrity deals
ever. Some you‚Äôve probably never heard of but could learn a lot
from.

These deals are ones where celebs negotiated above and beyond any
of their peers to get gigantic returns ‚Äì and probably really
happy kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids.

Let‚Äôs dig in.

‚Äã

-------------
Ryan Reynolds
-------------

His brilliant contrarian marketing framework: ‚ÄúFastvertising‚Äù
-------------------------------------------------------------

Quick timeline of Reynolds‚Äô three biggest deals:

* 2018: Purchased a majority stake in Aviation Gin, a craft gin
company. He sold it for $610Million to European alcohol company
Diageo in 2020.
* 2019: Became owner of Mint Mobile, a low-cost wireless
provider. He sold Mint to T-Mobile for around $1.35B in March
2023 ‚Äì earning a payout of more than $300M from his stake.
* 2020: Purchased Welsh football club Wrexham AFC with Rob
McElhenney for $2.5M. They turned it into $4M with the FX
documentary ‚ÄúWelcome to Wrexham.‚Äù (Season 2 spoiler: The club
will continue to rise in value after being crowned National
League Champions and earning a promotion to the next league.)

Not bad for a guy who got his start on a show called ""Two Girls,
A Guy, And a Pizza Place.""

So, how does he do it?

He uses his digital marketing agency, Maximum Effort, and their
framework called ‚Äúfastvertising.‚Äù

This strategy leverages our short attention spans and news
cycles.

They take whatever is trending in news or pop culture and
immediately create ads on it for Ryan‚Äôs companies.

Like his recent one for Mint Mobile starring Ronald Gladden (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/p9unkowzdda9h3z0zxgtp/qvh8h7hr42x6eptl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1MUWFrbURxUXRwTQ==
) of the hit series ‚ÄúJury Duty.‚Äù Or that time Peloton put out an
ad where a husband gifted his wife an exercise bike and everyone
freaked out, so Aviation Gin hired the actress (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/p9unkowzdda9h3z0zxgtp/g3hnh5h3lovzg5cr/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9UVmRFdURRZUwtVQ==
).

You can‚Äôt be Ryan Reynolds, so settle for the next best thing by
stealing his marketing strategy.

‚Äã

--------------
George Clooney
--------------

Cheers to The billion-dollar tequila brand ""Casamigos""
------------------------------------------------------

‚Äã
There‚Äôs something about celebrities and alcohol that creates
bulletproof brands.

Mr. Danny Ocean himself was one of the pioneers.

In 2013, Clooney co-founded ‚ÄòCasamigos Tequila‚Äô with his friends
Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman. In 2017, the trio sold the brand
to Diageo for $1Billion.

‚Äã

-------------------------
Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson
-------------------------

On the cusp of billionaire status witH Termana Tequila
------------------------------------------------------

‚Äã
Despite his high Hollywood status, Dwayne is a bright businessman
with successful ventures, including XFL, Zoa, and Acorns.

But one of his most lucrative is Termana Tequila. (I‚Äôm telling
you‚Ä¶ something about celebs and liquor.)

In 2021, the brand sold over 600,000 cases and was reportedly
worth $3.5Billion, of which Johnson owns a 30% stake. Based on
the approximate valuation and his equity, the billionaire club is
calling.

‚Äã

----------------
Bethenny Frankel
----------------

The 'SkinnyGirl' who sold for $120M
-----------------------------------

In the spirit of spirits, let‚Äôs look at another intoxicating
success story.

Bethenny Frankel, well-known for ‚ÄúReal Housewives of New York,‚Äù
is quite the businesswoman. She‚Äôs a NY Times Bestseller and
founder of the Skinnygirl (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/p9unkowzdda9h3z0zxgtp/9qhzhnhp63724vu9/aHR0cHM6Ly9za2lubnlnaXJscHJvZHVjdHMuY29tLw==
) brand, which offers low-calorie cocktails, snacks, and clothing
(well, the clothing isn‚Äôt low-calorie).

In 2011, Frankel sold the cocktail line to Beam Suntory for $120
million.

But she‚Äôs not one to sell the farm and call it quits. We‚Äôre
talking about the woman who once proudly said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point
of being on TV if you don‚Äôt have something to sell?‚Äù

In the Beam deal, she negotiated to keep the rights to the name
‚ÄúSkinnygirl.‚Äù She gets a payout for every alcohol sale, every
branded shotglass, and any other licensing opportunity she dreams
up.

The girl may be skinny, but the wallet‚Äôs fat.

Jay-Z
-----

rapPer to $600M champagne tycoon
--------------------------------

‚Äã
Jay-Z the rapper is arguably the greatest of all time.

Jay-Z the entrepreneur earned a net worth of over $1B, making him
one of the wealthiest celebrities in the world.

On his resume:

* Founder of Roc Nation Sports, a sports agency that represents
professional athletes.
* Tidal, a music streaming service that he acquired and
relaunched in 2015.
* The champagne brand Armand de Brignac, valued around $600M, of
which he sold 50% to luxury goods company LVMH in 2021.

When you become famous, they must make you sign something that
obligates you to build an alcohol empire.

Dr. Dre
-------

The rap icon who made a $3B deal
--------------------------------

In May 2014, Apple announced it was acquiring Beats Electronics,
the company co-founded by rapper and producer Dr. Dre and music
executive Jimmy Iovine ‚Äì for a whopping $3B.

At the time, it was the largest acquisition in Apple's history.
It included the Beats by Dre brand of headphones and speakers, as
well as the company's streaming service, Beats Music.

It was a strategic move by Apple, during the upswing of
streaming‚Äôs domination of the industry and the pre-Airpod era.

Also a strategic move by Dr. Dre because, well, $3Billion.

‚Äã

-----------------
Reese Witherspoon
-----------------

How to turn books into billions
-------------------------------

‚Äã
The numbers of this deal are good, but the strategy behind them
is absolutely brilliant.

Reese Witherspoon founded Hello Sunshine, a media company focused
on female-driven storytelling, in 2016. It sold to a newly-formed
co backed by Blackstone in 2021.

The deal valued Hello Sunshine at about $900Million, with
Witherspoon and other execs retaining significant ownership
stakes and joining the new company's board.

Now, the strategy:

* Reese has a book club with nearly 2.5M subscribers.
* She makes deals with publishers to feature books in the club in
return for gaining the rights to turn the IP into TV
shows/movies.
* She shops the series to studios like Netflix, Apple TV, and
HBO.
* Her media company produces it into Emmy award winners.

She's got a cycle going: gain access to content, validate it with
subscribers, and distribute it on a higher scale.

It's the best kind of deal because everyone wins: The publishers
get book revenue. The streaming companies get great content.
Witherspoon gets licensing $, funds production on the streaming
companies' dime, and cycles profits back into the book club.

Kylie Jenner
------------

The Kardashian not named ‚ÄòKim‚Äô who built a $600M cosmetics empire
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Kylie Jenner founded Kylie Cosmetics in 2015 with just a few
products, including a ""lip kit"" that quickly became a viral
sensation. (Lest we forget that one challenge that completely
sucked (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/p9unkowzdda9h3z0zxgtp/3ohphkh729wdxear/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3eW9yay9uZXdzL2t5bGllLWplbm5lci1saXAtY2hhbGxlbmdlLWRhbmdlcnMv
)‚Ä¶)

The brand's early success was largely driven by Jenner's social
media following and personal brand, creating millions of built-in
dedicated fans.

In 2018, Kylie Cosmetics was valued at $800Million, making Jenner
the youngest self-made billionaire in history at the time (She is
reported not to be in the billionaire club anymore as sales
slowed since 2020).

Coty Inc., a global beauty conglomerate, acquired a 51% stake in
Kylie Cosmetics for $600Million in 2019. This valued the company
at $1.2Billion. As part of the deal, Jenner remained the public
face of Kylie Cosmetics and retained a 49% ownership stake in the
company.

LeBron James
------------

How the world‚Äôs best basketball player scores paydays off-court
---------------------------------------------------------------

‚Äã
His basketball talent alone made him over $400M in his 20+ year
career.

Then you throw in his income from endorsements and business
ventures, and you get LeBron, the billionaire.

These deals include:

* Minority ownership of the Liverpool football club through its
parent company, Fenway Sports Group (his 2% stake is worth over
$30M).
* 19 franchises of Blaze Pizza, a fast-casual chain that‚Äôs
growing blazing fast (sorry, I had to).
* His production company, SpringHill Entertainment, signing a
deal with Universal Pictures in 2020 (Space Jam 2).

These strategic business decisions have not only made him one of
the wealthiest athletes in the world but paved the way for him to
continue to generate income and create opportunities for himself
and future generations. A true baller, if you will.

How You Can Replicate This
--------------------------

My challenge to you this week:

Star in a superhero movie, become a reality TV star, or gain 5M
IG followers.

Not really.

Truth is, you don‚Äôt need any of this to build an empire of your
own. So many celebs end up washed up and spit out, regardless of
their stardom.

It‚Äôs not the fame that makes these deals successful ‚Äì it‚Äôs the
smarts.

My true challenge to you:

Find a piece in one of these deals that‚Äôs replicable on your
scale.

Start a content flywheel. Get a licensing deal. Build around a
growing trend for a big exit.

Let‚Äôs build your empire.

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

I can think of only one good excuse why you shouldn‚Äôt pursue business ownership:

You don‚Äôt have the drive. You don‚Äôt actually want to own a business. We choose our hard in this life, and this is not the hard you‚Äôre going for.

But, I‚Äôve NEVER heard a good excuse from someone who wants to buy a business.

If you've decided small business acquisition is your path to financial freedom, then your reasons for not doing it come down to one thing. Fear.

What destroys fear? Knowledge and action.

So I‚Äôm inviting you to the free, live masterclass I‚Äôm hosting tomorrow(!) on the 10 steps I‚Äôve used to buy 20+ cashflowing businesses. We have 500 seats left and this email is sent to 70k subscribers... So sign up here (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/cashflow-masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=may-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID)  soon.

For today, let me give you a mindset makeover and bust the 6 most common biz-buying excuses.


** In 5 minutes or less:
------------------------------------------------------------
* ‚ÄúMy W-2 is just safer‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never run a business‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the capital‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the time‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow would I even find a business?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the expertise‚Äù


** ‚ÄúMy W-2 is just safer.‚Äù
------------------------------------------------------------

We call these golden handcuffs (https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1647231810718294016?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID) . Just shiny enough to let us forget we‚Äôre not in control.

We've been conditioned about the security of a W-2 job. They tell you the safe path is to diligently climb the corporate ladder, then retire in comfort.

The uncomfortable truth: Job security is a flimsy illusion.

Corporate downsizing, economic downturns, and industry disruptions can knock you off that ladder in a heartbeat.

Instead of relying solely on a job, consider small business acquisition as a means to build your own security. Many owners in our Mastermind group still work their fulltime (or parttime) job while a hired operator handles the day-to-day. Your W-2 doesn‚Äôt have to be the enemy of your business ventures.

But it doesn‚Äôt need to be the hero either.

In a survey of small business owners, 45.9% of them held a corporate job before running their business. Think they wish they‚Äôd stuck with that job a bit longer?

Nope. 85.4% of them regretted not becoming an owner sooner. (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221201005232/en/85.4-of-Small-Business-Owners-Regret-Not-Starting-Their-Business-Earlier-%E2%80%94-New-Survey-on-Motivations-of-Canadian-Entrepreneurs?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID)

Will future-you wish past-you had committed to a business already?

We've had people (like Paul and Mary) keep their jobs while adding a couple of laundromats to their asset column and income stream. We've also had people (like Renan and Brett) make a business purchase that supported them quitting their W-2 job altogether.

You get to choose your path, but you have to take the first step.


** ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never run a business.‚Äù
------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs an easy excuse for those who‚Äôve yet to step into acquisitions.

Fear of the unknown is natural, but the truth is: nobody starts as a business guru.

Every biz owner had to start somewhere.

Some of the biggest names in entrepreneurship built before any formal training or professional experience: Walt Disney, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Arianna Huffington (yes, that Huffington).

Past business experience certainly can impact business success. But just as important are the skills and traits a future owner brings to the table.

Studies show (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594320701595438?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID)  the following traits most often correlate with business success:
* need for achievement
* generalized self-efficacy
* innovativeness
* stress tolerance
* need for autonomy
* proactive personality

Whether these traits are intrinsic inside you or skills you‚Äôve developed throughout your career, this is what makes you a successful business owner.

Your W-2 job has given you a toolkit of skills ‚Äì leadership, problem-solving, communication ‚Äì that are put to the test on the entrepreneurial battlefield. Don't think inexperience holds you back.

The most successful entrepreneurs are the ones willing dive in headfirst. The ones who desire to win, learn as they go, and adapt like champions.


** ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the capital.‚Äù
------------------------------------------------------------

Contrary to popular belief, buying a business doesn't necessarily require a huge amount of upfront capital.

One beauty of business acquisitions is the creativity and flexibility available in financing structures (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/struggling-to-come-up-with-the-cash-to-buy-a-small-business/?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID) :
* SBA loans
* Raising funds
* Full or partial seller financing
* Partnerships with a trusted party
* Trading services for partial equity
* Smaller-scale acquisitions and ventures
* Earn-outs where the company's profit pays out to the seller over time

You‚Äôd be surprised at how little cash it can take to make a business yours. Explore your options before you use this excuse.

Our mastermind members have done plenty of deals with unique financing. From Lloyd buying a laundromat with all new equipment financed with only 5% down, to Renan buying an $8 Million home services company with 100% seller financing.

Funding a SMB acquisition is only limited by your imagination and negotiation skills. Find out what‚Äôs important to the seller and what they need to exit. It may not be the big wad of cash you think.


** ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the time.‚Äù
------------------------------------------------------------
If you‚Äôre working a full-time job, time constraints are a valid concern.

But there‚Äôs truth in the saying: ‚ÄúWhere there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way.‚Äù

Take a hard look at your schedule, identify the pockets of potential, and seize them. Steal time before and after your 9-5.

Assemble a team to decrease the load of the acquisition process: a great attorney, broker, and accountant will not only enable you to buy the best business‚Ä¶ But they‚Äôll allow you to do it without breaking from your W-2.

Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, but it damn well was built while juggling multiple commitments.


** ‚ÄúHow would I even find a biz?‚Äù
------------------------------------------------------------

There are lots of options for business sourcing: marketplaces, brokers, and off-market searches.

Online marketplaces can be a simple entry point for new buyers. Just to name a few:
* Flippa
* BizQuest
* Bizbuysell
* Acquire.com
* BusinessForSale

You can also get connected with brokers. Think of it like using a realtor to help find a house. They have connections and information that online business-buying platforms just don‚Äôt have.

But off-market opportunities can be the cheapest and offer the most growth:
* Spend time where small business owners (think retirees) might be. Get inside their network.
* Utilize SMB resources, like local libraries, chambers of commerce, and SBA offices (https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-locations?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID)
* Find local businesses on google. Visit them and meet the owner.
* Scrape data from online to cold-call.

Our favorite tool for off-market business-buying is Bizscout (https://www.bizscout.io/?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID) . Based on your zip code and the type/industry of business you want to buy, they give you the data of hundreds of solid leads to reach out to.

Dip your toe into acquisitions, and you‚Äôll quickly find that buyable businesses are all around you.


** ‚ÄúI don't have the expertise.‚Äù
------------------------------------------------------------

You don‚Äôt need to be a certified genius to kickstart your biz-buying journey.

Worried you can‚Äôt own a plumbing co if you've never been a plumber? Stretch your hiring muscles and find a competent operator to take over where your expertise leaves off. (Better yet: make an existing operator criterion for your buy box.)

Think you don‚Äôt have what it takes to even be an owner? Scroll back up to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never run a business before‚Äù excuse. Then come back here, and remember you‚Äôre not an island.

You aren‚Äôt the first person to ever run a business. The SMB owner community is a well of expertise ‚Äì draw from it.

Rub shoulders at industry events, and join business communities (like our Mastermind (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/mastermind/?mc_cid=e20569c78f&mc_eid=UNIQID) , or local groups).

Tap into the collective wisdom of like-minded individuals.


** Enough excuses. Let‚Äôs start.
------------------------------------------------------------

Do you really want the freedom of business ownership?

Is small business acquisition the hard you want to choose?

Or will you opt for the comfort and false-security of your 9-5?

Because I‚Äôm not buying your excuses. And you shouldn‚Äôt either.

I give you full permission to start. Start without all the answers (you can't get them). Start before it feels comfortable (it never will). Start when you‚Äôre not an expert (or else you‚Äôll never become one).

Hey Contrarians,

Last week, I met a guy who ran a business for 61 years.

That‚Äôs six decades.

He now lives in Monaco, is a billionaire, has kids, a beautiful
wife, and an insane life.

It made me think:

‚ÄãWhat if time is the main ingredient (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/68u0v4g7ppc8hk73wqza9/dpheh0h0oe0dp6hm/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9Db2RpZV9TYW5jaGV6L3N0YXR1cy8xNjYyODg4MjI4MTkyNDkzNTcx
)?

In life, we always look for the next hack, the right business
model, the path less traveled we can optimize and outsource to
ChatGPT.

We‚Äôve completely forgotten why we‚Äôre entrepreneurs ‚Äì to build
something so big, we live long after we die.

To do that takes one thing more than anything else... Time.

‚Äã

------------------------------------------
Today in 10 minutes or less, you'll learn:
------------------------------------------

‚úîÔ∏è Frameworks from a billionaire

‚úîÔ∏è Time kills all things

‚úîÔ∏è One thing most fortunes have in common

‚úîÔ∏è Travel is a teacher

‚úîÔ∏è The kick in the a$$ you need

‚Äã

-----------------------------
Frameworks from a billionaire
-----------------------------

As I sat on a plane heading out of France, a well dressed ‚Äì dare
I say kind of good looking ‚Äì elderly chap sat down next to me.

Nice watch? Check. Custom baggage? Check. Drinks tea with a
pinkie raised? Check.

I have a rule of largely NEVER talking on a flight, but I was
intrigued. I knew he had a story. So we struck up a conversation.

The next 2 hours flew by and ended with his concierge meeting us
at the door, expedited security, an offer of his second driver
and to come meet his family in Monaco this summer.

You know, normal-people stuff.

His name is Geoffrey Kent, he‚Äôs a billionaire, and he arguably
started the luxury travel market we know today. I left with a few
frameworks that will change how I do business forever. Maybe
they‚Äôll do the same for you.

‚Äã

---------------------
Time kills all things
---------------------

But time, it can also build all things.

Geoffrey ran Abercrombie and Kent for 61 years. There is a lesson
in that.

His story in 61 seconds:

His billion dollar company all started with him being born in
1942 in Zambia. He was raised in Kenya to hunt, ride horses, and
question authority. He got expelled from school at 16 for having
a motorcycle. Instead of switching schools, he went on a
two-month road trip where he became the first person to travel
3,000 miles on motorcycle from Kenya to Cape Town. Not a safe
route to say the least.

His thread of adventure carried through enrollment in the British
military, to becoming the world polo champion alongside the
Prince of Wales. One day, he realized he wanted to integrate his
love for adventure and travel in business. So in 1962, he started
Abercrombie & Kent with the idea to do photographic safaris and
the slogan, ‚ÄúHunt with a camera, not with a gun.‚Äù He created the
first luxury camping tent experience in Africa, and today A&K has
55 offices in more than 30 countries, offering 100s of tours
across all seven continents.

He‚Äôs managed to make millions while adventuring across the
arctic, circumnavigating the globe in a private plane, and hiking
peaks from Kilimanjaro to Torres del Paine. How?

He said, ‚ÄúThere is one magic word. Time.‚Äù

What if the recipe is simply:

‚Äã

‚Äã

-------------------------------------------
The one thing most fortunes have in common‚Ä¶
-------------------------------------------

When someone has made a lot of money and you dig into their
background, I can almost guarantee you one thing:

You‚Äôll find some acquisitions there.

* Geoffrey actually sold A&K to a Chinese Private Equity firm in
2016.
* Then bought it back for pennies on the dollar when that company
stumbled.
* Acquired the polar expedition ship MV Explorer in 1992.
* Recently bought Crystal Cruises, a luxury cruise line.

When you know how to play the game, you learn to look for deals
everywhere. You learn these three beautiful words:

Buy + Your + Profits.

Turns out, unless you have a home run of an idea powered by a
titanium level of resolve, the acquisition path is just smarter.

‚Äã

-------------------
Travel is a teacher
-------------------

I feel like that might be on 90% of Instagram bios, right next to
‚ÄúLive, Laugh, Wanderlust‚Äù and all the used and abused John Muir
quotes.

And yet, there‚Äôs something poignant in its truth. Travel teaches.
And we crave it.

‚Äã
We get so wrapped up in our biz's and careers, we kick our bucket
list down the path.

There is saying we use in business-buying: ‚ÄúDo you have a job or
a business?‚Äù

What‚Äôs the difference? A business runs without you. A job is tied
to your time.

As we come into the summer, I think about all the business owners
who will miss that vacation with their family, who will spend the
two weeks in their cell phone. (I‚Äôm looking at myself on this
one, Codie.)

Then I remember founders like Peter Lohmann (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/68u0v4g7ppc8hk73wqza9/owhkhqhr6wrxqmfv/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vdGhlLWJ1c2luZXNzLWlkLWRvLWluLWEtcmVjZXNzaW9uLw==
), who takes off a month a year without a cell phone while
running a million dollar business, or Ann who runs a $100Million
(
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/68u0v4g7ppc8hk73wqza9/p8heh9hz24zrqqfq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1FdFY5bWFKSVFiTSZ0PTM3cw==
) business while traveling 100 days a year.

We used to work, travel, and vacation like this‚Ä¶

‚Äã
Now we do it a bit like this‚Ä¶

‚Äã
Geoffrey says, ‚ÄúTravel teaches us as much about ourselves as it
does about the world.‚Äù

What if he‚Äôs right?

‚Äã

----------------------------
The kick in the a$$ you need
----------------------------

I have a question for you.

Have you noticed increasingly that we run our businesses from our
keyboards, forgetting about the world around us? That our neck
cranes down to manage, not up to marvel?

When did we become a group of vitamin-D-deprived,
Allbird-wearing, alternative-milk-drinking, extreme
PowerPointers, who dream of get-rich-quick NFT schemes?

Many of us got soft. We don‚Äôt climb mountains. We only take risks
with other people‚Äôs money. We sit behind keyboards bragging about
how ChatGPT did all the work.

How can you make the most money by employing the fewest people
and doing the least work? How can you get mailbox money? Or a
fast exit you can tweet about?

What a terrible thing to strive for.

The secret: Entrepreneurs don‚Äôt exist just for a bunch of zero‚Äôs
and some big exit, but because we are crazy people willing things
into very existence. We are supposed to be the next generation of
explorers, risk-takers, adrenaline junkies. Addicts to the
masochistic mission of achievement and ownership.

The feeling of being so damn unemployable your only option is
owner.

The inability to sleep because of visions so big they pull you
from bed in the dead of the night.

Dreams so futuristic, people laugh at them.

Those are the entrepreneurs I admire.

We‚Äôre investing in entrepreneurs like them... Who don‚Äôt want
passive income, they want f*ing empires.

My husband and I have a saying:

‚ÄúProtect those who can‚Äôt, cast aside those who won‚Äôt, enable
those who want.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs to all of you who want so badly that your wants become
realities.

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

There were around 280.8M cars registered in the US in 2022. Can you guess how many carwashes there are to service all those vehicles? Just over 60,000 (https://www.detailpropos.com/blog/car-wash-statistics/?mc_cid=5d04c3342a&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

60k locations to service nearly 3M cars‚Ä¶

Do you smell that? Kind of smells like opportunity to us (and maybe a little soap).

It‚Äôs slippery, though ‚Äì macro opportunity doesn‚Äôt always mean a smart acquisition.

But in this case? It might just be the biz for you. Let's see.

According to Advanton (https://advanton.com/car-wash-franchise/?mc_cid=5d04c3342a&mc_eid=UNIQID) , it costs between $40,000 and $300,000 on average to buy a carwash franchise, whereas a mobile carwash business will typically sell for $30,000 to $100,000.

Huge potential here for growth and expansion, but a few downsides, too. You can get a cash-flowing carwash for cheap, but there are several factors at play, like:
* location
* number of washing bays
* quality of the equipment.

But ultimately, we think a carwash is a great idea to add to your portfolio ‚Äì or even be your very first biz.

Here are the top 4 reasons we love them:


** 1. Carwashes will exist as long as cars exist
------------------------------------------------------------
The demand for carwashes will always be around, as long as we are driving cars (or until Elon comes up with a self-cleaning car‚Ä¶ anything‚Äôs possible).

And the beauty of carwashes is that, for the most part, they just need to exist.

Do you go out of your way for the best carwash in town? Probably not.

You probably have a go-to spot by the grocery store, near your house, and across the street from your gym.

Most of the time, carwash customers are looking for one thing: convenience.

Get location locked, and the cash flows.


** 2. Profit day 1
------------------------------------------------------------
You can‚Äôt beat the stellar profit margin opportunities of a carwash.

According to Profitable Venture (https://www.profitableventure.com/pros-cons-car-wash-business/?mc_cid=5d04c3342a&mc_eid=UNIQID) , self-service and smaller-scale carwashes can yield as much as $40,000 in profit each year while larger, luxury carwashes can earn upwards of $500,000 in annual profit.

There are also endless ways to upsell your customers and easily add to your margin, even if you‚Äôre only adding $1 to the cost of your wash. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown‚Ä¶
* Let's say, all in, the cost to operate your carwash once is $2.75. You want a low cost point to get people in the door, so you go with $3 per wash? That‚Äôs a 25-cent profit margin.

* But what happens if you decide to raise the cost of your base carwash to $4? Sounds pretty good, and your customers probably won‚Äôt notice the difference in cost. But you get $1.25 profit per wash. That‚Äôs a 500% increase in profit margin.

* You‚Äôve seen how creative carwashes get with upcharges. We‚Äôre talking: vacuum, foam, undercarriage rinse, windshield repellant, deluxe wash, ultimate wash, extreme deluxe ultimate wash with cherry sprinkles. The options are limitless. Higher price points can have a huge impact on your margins, without adding a lot of complexity to your operations.


** 3. Smaller marketing budget
------------------------------------------------------------
Let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶ your customers aren‚Äôt searching far and wide to find a carwash they love. Most likely, they‚Äôre looking for a place that does a good job, fits within their budget, and is close to where they live. That means your marketing and advertising budget likely doesn‚Äôt need to be as huge as it would be for other industries.

But this also means your location is 10x as important as the money you pump into your marketing budget.

While you might be saving dollars on things like mailers, ads, and other promotional materials, it might be worth spending a bit more upfront on a deal if the carwash is in a better location than the competition. Bad location? You‚Äôre sunk in the suds.


** 4. Franchise opportunity
------------------------------------------------------------
This one is for my boring business moguls who are looking to streamline the assets in their portfolios. Once you solve the overall operational model at one location, you‚Äôre better equipped for opportunities to franchise at other wash locations.

Acquiring a few different carwashes might be something to explore if you live near or are looking for business opportunities in a larger suburban area.

There are also plenty of opportunities within this industry to build on additional features, products, and services (think detailing, tire service, or even windshield repair) at a low operational cost to you.


** Caution: Potential pitfalls
------------------------------------------------------------

Not to completely pop your bubble, but there‚Äôs no such thing as a risk-free business. Here are a few cons you‚Äôll need to think about, too‚Ä¶
1. Weather. One bad month or a particularly rainy season can have a major (and unpredictable!) impact on your quarterly and annual revenue. You could build an unlimited subscription model to ensure recurring revenue and act as weather insurance. Still ‚Äì some risk remains.
2. Location. This is the one factor when buying that can‚Äôt be changed. It‚Äôs also arguably the most important predictor of a carwash‚Äôs success. Look for:
+ A high-traffic area
+ Easy access from a major road
+ With few nearby competitors.
+ Convenience. Wins.
3. Maintenance. While this business is relatively simple to get started (especially if you‚Äôre buying a turnkey operational carwash), expect many hidden costs ‚Äì particularly in the maintenance category.
If you buy a machine-operated carwash, these pieces of massive equipment can break. This is expensive in two ways: 1) paying for specialized repairs, and 2) your entire business shuts down until those repairs happen.
Carwashes require quite a bit of available cash-on-hand to mitigate maintenance risk.

Ready to proceed with caution?

Let's check out the steps you need to take to buy a carwash of your very own.


** 5 steps to buy your own carwash
------------------------------------------------------------

Carwashes are a great business, whether you‚Äôre a biz-buying first-timer or this is the tenth company in your portfolio.

Everyone from Shaq (https://contrarianthinking.co/shaq-400m-from-carwashes-franchises/?mc_cid=5d04c3342a&mc_eid=UNIQID) to 22-year-old Hannah Ingram (https://www.instagram.com/thehannahingram/?mc_cid=5d04c3342a&mc_eid=UNIQID)  can be successful at buying and maintaining a profiting carwash (or carwash empire).

Taking some hints from Ingram‚Äôs success, here‚Äôs how you can buy your own carwash.


** 1. Look up: Know where to search
------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúIf carwashes are such great cash cows, why would anyone want to sell them?‚Äù

Well, the same reasons as always:
* Behind on taxes.
* Business fatigue.
* Relocating to another state.

The list goes on and on. But as long as you choose not to look, you‚Äôll never find these deals ripe for the taking.

You can try BizBuySell, Loopnet, or any other biz marketplaces. But honestly, the best deals will be right under your nose.

Search up carwashes near you. Note any with a lacking online presence, sad look, and great location. Take a drive by. See if the owner is around or if you can get their direct contact info.

Sometimes the owners of neglected businesses just need permission to get out. You can be their opportunity as much as they are yours.

Potential pros of an off-market search:
* Price may be lower
* Little to no buying competition
* Seller financing may be an option
* More growth opportunities (the biz had no buyers to impress, so likely hasn‚Äôt reached its full potential)
* Get a wider off-market search with the powerhouse micro-tool Bizscout (https://www.bizscout.io/?mc_cid=5d04c3342a&mc_eid=UNIQID)


** 2. Study up: Learn seller financing
------------------------------------------------------------

Especially if you‚Äôre looking at a carwash as your first acquisition, seller financing could be your #1 way in:
* It‚Äôs cheaper. You‚Äôre looking at as little as 0-10% cash down on the purchase.
* The seller keeps a little skin in the game, so you‚Äôve got them on your team after closing.
* You can avoid the loan process, which means you don‚Äôt have to involve your credit, and you don‚Äôt have to navigate a maze of paperwork.

All it takes is a little background knowledge of your seller, a coating of confidence, and killer negotiator skills.


** 3. Lawyer up: Get a SBA attorney
------------------------------------------------------------

Not in a scary way. Like with every other property acquisition, seller financing can get technical.

It‚Äôs critical to hire a legal expert to hash out the finer details of your contract. (Even when you have the basics down.)

It‚Äôll cost a bit upfront to draw up the right papers, but a good lawyer is almost always worth the cost.


** 4. Shape up: Improve the biz
------------------------------------------------------------

Find where the last owner was falling short, and fill in the gaps. Flex your marketing muscles. Throw on a new coat of paint. Differentiate your carwash with amenities.

In Ingram‚Äôs case, she attributes a good portion of her weekly turnover to her vending machines that stock only five car care products:
* Glass cleaner
* Air fresheners
* Tire shine
* Interior sponges
* Absorbent towels

Air fresheners, which she buys for $0.20 apiece and resells for $1.25, are by far her bestsellers. That‚Äôs a 500% markup.


** 5. Rollup: Build your M&A empire
------------------------------------------------------------

The carwash industry has a rare quality: there are very few big players. Even the largest chains don‚Äôt have a market share greater than 5%.

Translation?

Disaggregation means opportunity.

A horizontal merger is one way to expand while safeguarding your cash flow against seasonal fluctuations. By acquiring carwashes up north where there‚Äôs higher customer volume during winter and more down south where the boom typically comes in summer, you could keep your annual revenue more even.

Of course, you could also decide to branch out vertically. At $160 per detail and $12B+ in revenue, car detailing is one related (and high-value) boring business to add on.

You probably didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be a carwash mogul when you grew up, but hey ‚Äì you did want to make money, right?

Hey Contrarians,

Ever notice how often we think in shoulds?

‚ÄúI should go to college.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should take out another loan.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should focus on promotion at my 9-5.‚Äù

Shoulds often maintain a status quo. Shoulds are about settling.

In his book ‚ÄúMagic Words,‚Äù Jonah Berger suggests turning shoulds
into coulds: ‚ÄúRather than black and white, or either/or, ‚Äòcould‚Äô
encourages people to realize there might be alternate paths.‚Äù

It brings a creative mindset to problems.

That‚Äôs this newsletter.

The story of someone so sick of a life of debt, she took matters
into her own hands with an income stream most people would look
at and think, ‚ÄúI should not try that.‚Äù

This is the story of a $25k Could.

Contrarian framework: How could it work?

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt work.‚Äù

Ever catch yourself thinking that when you read these
newsletters? Or hear an entrepreneur‚Äôs story? Or learn about a
new side hustle?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too simple.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt probably doesn‚Äôt pay off.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt scale.‚Äù

Most gravitate toward why it won't work.

The secret all entrepreneurs learn?

Shut up that part of your brain. Train your mind to instead ask:

‚ÄúHow could it work?‚Äù

If you learn to risk asking questions like, ‚ÄúHow could I turn
cheap stuff into thousands?‚Äù

Then you risk being rewarded by‚Ä¶ A life-changing, scaled
furniture-flipping business.

Like Lauren.

----------------------------------------------------------
The side hustle that paid off $25K of student debt in 6mos
----------------------------------------------------------

Like many millennials, Lauren Hull was spending her mid-20s
staring student debt in the face, wondering how she could pay it
off in a reasonable time ‚Äì on a kindergarten teacher‚Äôs salary.

So, as the sh*tstorm we commonly refer to as the year 2020 was
coming to a close, she started a side hustle to help pay off the
debt.

The side hustle? Flipping furniture.

Yes, the same concept as flipping houses, but on a much smaller,
more repeatable scale.

Lauren didn‚Äôt have the capital for full-scale fix-and-flips in
her market. But what she did have were craftsman skills, a ‚Äúhow
could I make this work?‚Äù mindset, and Facebook Marketplace.

These three things not only helped pay off a $25k debt in six
months, but they led to a 5-figure per month, 225k-follower
YouTube channel ‚ÄúFurniture Flipping Teacher (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg3gk9pu3/08hwh9hd9n5rdral/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vQEZ1cm5pdHVyZUZsaXBwaW5nVGVhY2hlcg==
),‚Äù and a path to build a flipping empire.

Now, let's break down how she turned piles into profit.

‚Äã

------------------------------------------------------
Why FB Marketplace is all you need to copy her success
------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôve ever sold anything on Facebook Marketplace, you know
it‚Äôs an‚Ä¶ experience.

For the unchristened, it usually goes a little something like
this:

You post an item for sale. You get between three and 300
responses saying, ‚ÄúIs this still available?‚Äù You never hear from
90% of them ever again. Until they come back crying because you
already sold the $15 lamp they never got back to you about.

Not a battlefield for the faint of heart.

That said, making money on FB Marketplace just takes a little
patience and street smarts. After all, one man‚Äôs trash is another
man‚Äôs furniture flip.

There‚Äôs a paradox on this platform: You can score promising
pieces others are getting rid of for pennies. Yet people are also
willing to buy quality furniture for hundreds of dollars.

(Bonus: you can take cash on Marketplace, saving you online
processing fees.)

Let‚Äôs look at Lauren‚Äôs flipping process:

1. Find furniture to flip.

Search for solid wood pieces under $75 (on FB Marketplace, at
thrift shops, etc.). Look for minimal signs of usage, and always
research the market value of the piece before buying.‚Äã(Trick of
the trade: search the piece on eBay, scroll down to ‚ÄúShow only,‚Äù
and check ‚ÄúSold Items.‚Äù Now you see the price people are actually
paying, not optimistic appraisals by wishful sellers.)

2. Negotiate the price.

Furniture takes up space. When people are getting rid of a piece,
it‚Äôs usually more important for it to be gone fast than for it to
bring in a lot of money. Major leverage: offering immediate
pickup.

3. Keep operating costs low.

Lauren does all this from her garage ‚Äì you don‚Äôt need an
expensive warehouse.

Good furniture can be refurbished on the cheap. It typically just
takes some sanding, replacing hardware, and adding fresh paint.

4. Sell.*

*For more than you paid. Crucial detail here.

Flip out over these results
---------------------------

Here‚Äôs one example of the results Lauren gets.

She picked up four chair sets, ranging in price from free to $60.
She paid $89 total.

‚Äã
Five hours of ripping, cleaning, stapling, and FB listing later,
she sold them all for $975 total, earning a net profit of $886.

$177 per hour for furniture re-selling. I guess you could say
this flipped my mindset on what‚Äôs possible with small-scale
renovations.

)‚Äã

‚Äã

--------------------------------
The key to scaling it into a biz
--------------------------------

Simple, smart, but is it scalable?

Lauren had a profitable side hustle. Now it was time to turn it
into a full-time career. But how?

Enter the creator economy.

‚Äã
I‚Äôm a big believer in content creation as documentation. One
thing that comes easy for you can be a game-changer for someone
else. If you‚Äôve done the work to learn a skill or trade, someone
else wants to learn from you.

How Lauren did it was simple.

She started to document her process and share her success
stories.

Quick sidebar: This type of content sells itself. People flip out
(okay, maybe I should take it easy on the ‚Äòflip‚Äô puns) watching
others flip stuff. HGTV puts out a new house-flipping show every
year, and if you search ‚Äúfurniture flip‚Äù on TikTok, you‚Äôll see
hundreds of videos with collective billions of views.

Before-and-after content is uber-digestible: visually appealing,
inspiring, and gives people the idea they can do it themselves.

Lauren tapped into this.

‚Äã
Take a look at her Instagram (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg3gk9pu3/vqh3hrhpvm7rp9tg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9mdXJuaXR1cmVmbGlwcGluZ3RlYWNoZXIv
) for a taste of her approachable style that nearly 250k
followers enjoy. She shares painting tips, before-and-afters,
what to look for, thrift shopping finds, and of course,
satisfying, dopamine-producing profit numbers.

That‚Äôs just her Instagram. Her YouTube channel brings in ad
revenue thanks to her 225k subscribers and 33M+ views. With over
300 videos, she makes around $20k/month from YT ads alone.

But she didn‚Äôt stop at content. She also offers:

* 1-on-1 furniture flipping coaching
* Flipping services
* An online course for $597.

For example, one couple found a furniture set for free and paid
Lauren to refurbish it. Yup ‚Äì she built enough credibility to be
hired for her craftsman services.

There‚Äôs a market for everything in the creator economy. Authentic
and helpful content makes you available to those seeking
solutions for problems you‚Äôve already solved.

I‚Äôd say Lauren has already proven furniture flipping can be
scalable. But what she‚Äôs currently working on intrigues me the
most‚Ä¶

‚Äã

-----------------------------
How far flipping can take you
-----------------------------

There‚Äôs a post on Lauren‚Äôs IG that tells me she‚Äôs playing the
long game.

She‚Äôs documenting renovating rooms and furniture for her Airbnb (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg3gk9pu3/l2hehmh3nq9738t6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9yZWVsL0Nzd3lSVEJMQjhFLz91dG1fc291cmNlPWlnX3dlYl9jb3B5X2xpbmsmaWdzaGlkPU16UmxPREJpTldGbFpBPT0=
) in Omaha.

The strategy here: Turn attention into opportunity into cash
flow, and repeat.

* Use money from furniture flipping to buy (or house hack (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/mvu54d9roou5hg3gk9pu3/m2h7h5h8q2pz84sm/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vbm90LXNheWluZy1pbS1hLWhhY2tlci1idXQtaWYtaS13ZXJlLw==
)?) an Airbnb.
* Consistently promote the Airbnb(s) to your half-a-million
network of followers = sold-out rooms month after month.
* Promote flipped furniture pieces to other Airbnb hosts. You can
set up a Shopify site marketing solely to Airbnb hosts. I‚Äôd hire
writers and own this SEO space.
* This is a BIG one. What about Airbnb renovation services? If
you‚Äôre already showing how you‚Äôre flipping furniture and
renovating rooms, why not sell this as a service? You‚Äôre the face
of the brand, now start hiring contractors to help. Start locally
and expand to nearby cities or vacation rental hot spots.

The right hustles don‚Äôt stay side hustles. Kudos to Lauren Hull
and the rest of the furniture flippers out there.

Like them, train your mind to ask‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHow could I make this work?‚Äù

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

You learn a lot about buying on your acquisitions journey. What you might not think as much about (but maybe should) is the seller‚Äôs side of the process.

To set the seller‚Äôs scene for acquisitions:

On average, 8 out of 10 businesses (https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2017/02/05/these-8-stats-show-why-many-business-owners-cant-sell-when-they-want-to/?sh=4d85d39044bd&mc_cid=e5dc42c997&mc_eid=UNIQID) don‚Äôt sell at all.

Many stable, profitable businesses shut down when the owner's ready to retire.

Why is that?

Let‚Äôs explore 3 reasons why businesses don‚Äôt sell ‚Äì and more importantly, how you can make the most of this opportunity.

* What is the Small Business Dilemma?
* Problem 1: The value of the business is a question mark
* Problem 2: Seller financing hasn‚Äôt been put on the table
* Problem 3: Listings are a nightmare
* 7 ways you can close a deal on a closing a business (on the cheap)


** What is the SMB Dilemma?
------------------------------------------------------------

80%+ of small businesses close forever instead of sell. That is a borderline crisis for the country.

There‚Äôs one ultimate reason why:

The owner doesn‚Äôt build an exit plan.

Small business owners are so consumed with running the business, they don‚Äôt have a plan for transferring ownership when they‚Äôre ready to be done.

Maybe they assumed the biz would stay in the family (https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/heres-why-your-children-should-not-inherit-your-business/446621?mc_cid=e5dc42c997&mc_eid=UNIQID) , but their millennial kid would rather focus on their own career, not dad‚Äôs boring business.

Maybe the biz is too reliant on tribal knowledge; there‚Äôs no documentation, no delegation, no financials.

Maybe the industry is dying and the biz doesn't pique buyer interest.

Or maybe it simply never crossed the owner‚Äôs mind to sell.

There are plenty of reasons why businesses end up with a closed sign instead of a for sale sign.

Let‚Äôs deep dive into 3 common reasons (that you may be able to leverage).


** 1. The value of the business is a question mark
------------------------------------------------------------
Problem #1: The owner doesn‚Äôt know the value of the business.

The most common reasons why owners sell their business are:
* Baby Boomer generation (aka, tired and/or ready to retire)
* Wants to move/relocate the business
* Wants to dissolve the family business
* No successor(s) in place
* Declining health

Sometimes, a business owner decides to sell their business without a lot of forethought. For that reason, they have significant gaps in the valuation process.

For example, a business owner may have a certain number in their head of what their biz is worth‚Ä¶ But they‚Äôve quite literally pulled it out of thin air.

According to a survey conducted by EPI (https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2017/02/05/these-8-stats-show-why-many-business-owners-cant-sell-when-they-want-to/?sh=1d2df17e44bd&mc_cid=e5dc42c997&mc_eid=UNIQID) , ~70% of business owners don‚Äôt know what their after-tax income should look like to support their lifestyle.

So, valuing and listing their business becomes one big guessing game.

This could sound like:
* ‚ÄúI need $2 million to pay off my business assets.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI need $1.5 million to retire, otherwise it isn‚Äôt worth it.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI heard that I need to make X-times my initial investment back for this to be a fair deal, so that‚Äôs what I expect in the sale.‚Äù

Another common factor here is the business owner has been so stuck in the day-to-day operations that they never set their business up to sell in the first place.

Standard operating procedures haven‚Äôt been documented. Ongoing maintenance and repairs took a back seat. Sometimes, books are even out of date by several months or more, making it challenging to have a conversation around the numbers.


** 2. Seller financing hasn‚Äôt been put on the table
------------------------------------------------------------
Problem #2: The owner insists on traditional financing.

There‚Äôs a high likelihood your seller is a Boomer, which means they‚Äôre probably only familiar with deals that are set up via a bank loan or the SBA. Aka, the old-school funding options.

Typically, these options take longer to work through because #bureaucracy.

It‚Äôs not that seller financing is off the table. It‚Äôs just more likely the current business owner doesn‚Äôt even know about it.

Mix traditional financing in with not knowing their numbers, and you‚Äôre looking at a looooong time to actually work through and close your deal‚Ä¶ If it even gets done at all.

This is another one of the top reasons that a business doesn‚Äôt sell.


** 3. Listings are a nightmare
------------------------------------------------------------
Problem #3: The owner is focusing on listing their deal (or, they don‚Äôt list it at all)

This one comes down to who the original owner has on their dealmaking team (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/deal-making-team/?mc_cid=e5dc42c997&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

If they‚Äôre working with a real estate agent, they may be following the more traditional approach to selling a business:

1. Decide to sell.
2. List the business.
3. Make the sale.

It sounds simple in theory, but sellers tend to throw a wrench in their own plans.

Most of the time, we see businesses listed on real estate sites or other online marketplaces have some major red flags:
* The business isn‚Äôt valued properly.
* The payment terms, or deal value, aren‚Äôt flexible for the buyer.
* Key financials and/or other info is missing from the deal structure.
* The business requires major renovation or equipment replacement.

Online listings are far from a death knell for a business ‚Äì and we‚Äôre not saying a biz listed online is off-limits for you as a buyer. But you do want to be cautious.
So, if a seller might have outdated financials, a nonsensical asking price, an inflexible financing structure, or an online listing littered with red flags, then‚Ä¶

What the hell is a buyer supposed to do?


** 7 ways you can close a deal on a closing a business (on the cheap)
------------------------------------------------------------

For as many issues as these seller problems cause‚Ä¶ They also cause opportunities.

8 in 10 businesses don‚Äôt sell. That stat is pure leverage for a buyer.

Most of these problems come down to a lack of preparation for a sale.

If you‚Äôre open to finding, getting to know, teaching, and negotiating with SMB owners, then you open yourself up to opportunities other buyers don‚Äôt even know exist.

Here are 7 unique ways you can leverage businesses on the brink of closing:
1. Seller financing. Want to buy a retiree‚Äôs business? Teach them about seller financing. (Heck, shoot ‚Äòem an Unconventional Acquisitions article (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/seller-financing/?mc_cid=e5dc42c997&mc_eid=UNIQID) if you need an icebreaker.) More sellers than you‚Äôd expect will opt for a seller note when they: 1) trust you‚Äôre not a total con artist, 2) understand how they benefit from a seller-financed deal, and 3) realize it can be a way to sell their business that may otherwise die.

2. Work backwards on a price together. A member of our Mastermind played this strategy out into a beautiful win-win for seller and buyer both. He worked with the seller to find out how much money he‚Äôd need month-to-month for his next stage of life. Using that number, they extrapolated out a balance. The final result (https://unconventionalacquisitions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/72e16c02-4647-2fee-3193-dae56001be51-1024x576.png?mc_cid=e5dc42c997&mc_eid=UNIQID) ? A $50k higher purchase price, but $550k of it was financed through a 0% interest, 7-year seller‚Äôs note.

3. Negotiate down. This is an obvious option‚Ä¶ That only sometimes works. Talk straight with the owner. If you love the business, tell them why. Then, explain your concerns about the absence of documentation, etc. Tell them a price you think is fair and why. They might just need someone to bring them back to reality.

4. Revenue or profit share acquisition. If a faltering business is open to support, you could swoop in with a revenue-share acquisition. Without buying a full business outright, you can put some money down, get a % stake in the company, offer your expertise to help grow the biz, then get a cut of profits or revenue every month.

5. Employee acquisition. Some closing businesses are a lost cause‚Ä¶ But their employees aren‚Äôt. If you own one biz and another one near you shuts down, you could work out a deal for everyone:
+ The old owner gets a finder‚Äôs fee for referring employees.
+ Employees get a new job, plus revenue share for each client they bring along to your company.
+ You grow with great talent and new clients.

6. Customer acquisition. Pro-tip on this one: don‚Äôt dance on the grave of a closing business. Instead, negotiate revenue share for clients the old owner refers to you. Bring them in for a farewell event, and they can handhold their clients over. Then close these new customers with an email sequence.

7. Referral fee for customer acquisition. Don‚Äôt own a business yet? You don‚Äôt have to buy a full biz to do a deal. If you see a business closing down, you can offer to facilitate a customer acquisition between it and another local business. Someone in our community provided this for a closing restaurant. They sent an email to the closing restaurant's customers with a 25% off code for an existing restaurant.
+ The closing biz made $2,250
+ The open biz rev'd $20k+
+ The facilitator got $1,500
+ And the customers got a discounted dinner at their new favorite spot.

Whatever the reason a business is closing, I want you to remember one important truth:

A business is NEVER worth $0.

Small business owners are some of the most passionate, hard-working people around. You do the world a service by finding a way to keep their legacy alive.

Hey Contrarians,

You know I love brick-and-mortar businesses.

Brash, boring, revenue-recurring,
walk-inside-and-shake-the-owner‚Äôs-hand businesses.

But.

I recently bought my first SaaS business (linked here (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/6qheh8h758pozouo/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYml6c2NvdXQuaW8v
), for the curious). And I get it ‚Äì digital businesses have a
huge appeal. Automation is baked in, incremental cost per client
is $0, and operating expenses are next to nothing. Easy to get
used to.

Most of all, digital businesses offer a unique possibility: solo
scaled empires.

That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll explore today, via the brilliant business model
by Brett Williams of Designjoy.

Contrarian framework: Are you Driving or Riding?
------------------------------------------------

I met a man, and he left a mark.

Humans can be like that when they've seen a thing or two. So I'm
going to tell you about my friend Maverick.

Tuesday. I sat out front watching the sun begin to set, another
day under the Texas trees.

I heard the rev of the motorcycle before I saw it. A deep purr
that became a roar. While the machine was impressive, the
character stepping off of it stole the show.

Let's just say our worlds didn't collide. Me in my Lulu‚Äôs, he in
his leathers. It was a lot to take in all at once. Tattoos
creeping up his neck, a missing tooth or two, boots wrapping his
legs, dirt embedded under his fingernails. One part in particular
stuck out: a knife. Well, more like if a knife and a sword had a
rather sizable baby.

He climbed off the bike, readjusted his, ahem, machete? Then
walked over to me, hand outstretched. ""Maverick,"" he said.

Caught staring, I stuttered. ""That's a beautiful bike. What is
that leather piece on top?""

He smiled showing one prominent tooth that was prone to wiggling
while talking. ""Oh, this here is an English saddle."" He ran his
sausage-sized fingers over the polished leather.

My forehead crinkled. ""A saddle on a Harley?""

He laughed.

""Well, of course, now. Harley's ain't for driving, they're for
riding.""

And just like that, I knew we would be friends and I would write
stories about this man.

It made me wonder‚Ä¶

Where can you ride a bit more than you drive?

Here‚Äôs one idea to put a little rev in your ride.

‚Äã

----------------------------------------
Freelancing will be more common than W-2
----------------------------------------

But it will probably make way less $.

No doubt there‚Äôs serious bank to be made online. But if you want
a little of that internet cha-ching for yourself? Freelancing
probably isn‚Äôt the game.

Sure, it's a great way to get your feet wet, but freelancing is
often a race to the bottom. With the freelance workforce becoming
increasingly global, it‚Äôs common to compete by driving your
prices into the ground.

‚ÄãFreelancers make up 47% of the global workforce. (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/kkhmh6hl508mr4fl/aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoanVyeS5uZXQvYmxvZy9mcmVlbGFuY2Utc3RhdGlzdGljcy8=
) That's 1.57 billion people, 73.3 million of whom are American.

Stiff competition.

Want to find another path in digital services? Well, agencies
aren‚Äôt so hot either.

The average digital agency with 10 full-time employees has a
profit margin of just 15% (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/58hvh7hmnd57q3t6/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9tZXRoZWFucmVzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMjMtZGlnaXRhbC1hZ2VuY3ktaW5kdXN0cnktcmVwb3J0Lw==
). Guess what their largest expense is? That‚Äôs right, salaries.

‚Äã
So freelancing is going to be a $12B industry in 5 years, but
going it alone is tough‚Ä¶ Scaling into a team? Also tough‚Ä¶

But there‚Äôs another ingenious way to scale your digital skill
into a million-dollar machine.

Let‚Äôs look at someone who‚Äôs cracked the code.

https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/25h2hoh28p7d66i3/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9CcmV0dEZyb21ESg==
), a graphics designer who now does $120,000 in MRR on average,
adding up to $1.3M in ARR. Not bad.

But it didn‚Äôt start with millions.

In 2017, Brett decided he wanted more than his 9-5 design job.
However, he didn't want to be another freelancer fighting for
penny-pinching clients. Nor did he want to start an agency where
he had to manage people and send all profit to payroll. So,
what's the third option?

A little thing he calls Design-as-a-Subscription.

Think of it as Netflix. You pay a subscription fee. But instead
of unlimited movies, you get to make unlimited graphic design
requests.

The keyword here is ‚Äúunlimited.‚Äù Whether you make 5 requests a
month or 50, the price stays the same. The caveat: you can only
make one request at a time.

An unusual model for a service business, right?

Eager to try out his idea, Brett created Designjoy in 2017. One
Saturday night, he threw together a website for $29 and launched
the next day on Product Hunt. 40,000 unique visits later,
Designjoy (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/qvh8h7hr4m8nzwhl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVzaWduam95LmNvLw==
) had fully taken off.

‚Äã

‚Äã

------------------------------
Why this biz model just‚Ä¶ works
------------------------------

Designjoy‚Äôs business model hits the sweet spot of clients'
graphic design needs.

It costs waaay too much $$$ to hire employees ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not just
about salaries and comp.

The cost of finding, interviewing, and training new employees is
through the roof. And that's if employers get it right on their
first try. Because let‚Äôs face it‚Ä¶ 45% of new hires are bad hires.

Plus, there's the hassle of keeping that FT employee fully
engaged. An in-house graphic designer can sit idle for weeks
without doing any real work. But we both know they‚Äôll get their
full paycheck at the end of the month.

‚Äã
Weigh the pros against the cons and you see how it‚Äôs easier, and
a heck of a lot cheaper, to just hire a service like Designjoy.

No recruiting, no vetting freelancers, no busy work, no
compensation plan, no taxes‚Ä¶ All you have to do is buy a
subscription, then forget you ever did.

An important key to the business model is this: even if clients
don't have enough work to fill an entire month, Brett allows them
to pause their subscription indefinitely. When they do have more
work for him, they can un-pause and continue wherever they left
off in the cycle.

Pair all this with top-notch deliverables, and a productized
service is an easy sell for clients.

------------------------------
5 steps to optimize a solo biz
------------------------------

Designjoy is a lean and mean operation from top to bottom.

Here's what I'm talking about:

1. It‚Äôs a one-man army. At $1.3M ARR, Brett is the only employee
at Designjoy. There are no other graphic designers. No closers.
Not even a VA for admin.

2. No client meetings. You can take an optional 15-minute
discovery call before taking the leap, but that's about it. Once
you become a Designjoy client, you never see Brett's face again.
Ever.‚ÄãAnd you know what? He's got the right idea.‚Äã15% of an
organization‚Äôs time is spent inmeetings (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/g3hnh5h3l8eprwur/aHR0cHM6Ly9vdHRlci5haS9ibG9nL21lZXRpbmctc3RhdGlzdGljcw==
) ‚Äì with some employees regularly spending 50% of their time in
them. The fact is, most meetings are frivolous, and a solo biz
can‚Äôt afford that.‚Äã(Not-so-fun fact: the U.S. economy loses $34
billion every year to pointless meetings (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/3ohphkh725qz05br/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuemlwcGlhLmNvbS9hZHZpY2UvbWVldGluZy1zdGF0aXN0aWNzLyM6fjp0ZXh0PVRoZSUyMGF2ZXJhZ2UlMjB3b3JrZXIlMjBzcGVuZHMlMjBhdCx0aG9zZSUyMG1lZXRpbmdzJTIwYXJlJTIwY29uc2lkZXJlZCUyMHVucHJvZHVjdGl2ZS4=
). Think about that the next time you‚Äôre on a Zoom call that
could have been an email.)

3. Prioritizing urgency. Cutting out red tape doesn't stop at how
Brett communicates with clients. It's how he onboards them,
too.‚ÄãThe onboarding process in a traditional agency looks like
this:‚ÄãVisit website > Book a call > Wait at least 1 day before
meeting the team > Set a follow-up call within the next 7 days >
Finalize price and scope of project > Sign contract > Begin
project.‚ÄãI lost my patience just reading through that.‚ÄãMost of my
business decisions require speed, so going through a process
that's longer than Game of Thrones is a big no-no for me.‚ÄãBrett
gets this. With Designjoy, you go from 1st-time visitor to paying
client in 30 seconds. No meetings. No contracts. No bullsh*t.‚Äã‚Äã4.
Leveraging (the right) tools. With zero employees, solo
businesses require a smart use of tools.

You might be wondering how Designjoy hasn't imploded if Brett has
zero contact with his clients. Well, to field design requests, he
uses a method so dead simple it'll make you cry‚Ä¶‚ÄãTrello. Yeah,
that's it.

‚Äã
Once they come on board, clients get access to their personal
Trello board where they can log design requests. On the backend,
Brett views these requests and fulfills them in 30 minutes to 48
hours ‚Äì all completely async.

5. Simplicity = $$$. Wondering how many clients this one-man-show
can handle? More than most. On average, Brett services ~20
clients every month. At $5k per client, Designjoy does $120,000
in MRR on average, adding up to $1.3M in ARR.

(
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/n2hohvh3x9nrmzt6/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9CcmV0dEZyb21ESi9zdGF0dXMvMTY2MTAzNzUwNTM0Nzc1MTkzNz9zPTIw
)‚Äã
Compare that against what he‚Äôd be making in a 9-5 ‚Äì an average
salary of $49k.

When it comes to operating expenses, Designjoy only has four:
Figma at $15/month, Webflow at $33/month, Shutterstock at
$99/month, and Adobe Creative Cloud at $29/month. All other
tools? $0/month.

If you‚Äôre crunching the numbers in your head, I got you. That‚Äôs a
99.78% profit margin. Spending $176 to make $120,000 is my kind
of math.

--------------------------
How you can replicate this
--------------------------

The beauty of Brett's productized service model is that it can be
applied to almost any digital skill.

Copywriting. Video editing. Facebook ads‚Ä¶ You name it.

‚Äã
The secret is to niche down narrowly.

Even within graphic design, there are niches within niches.

For example, while Designjoy tends to service tech startups, this
other Design-as-a-Service works with e-commerce brands, content
creators, and NGOs.

At $499 per month, DesignPickle (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/48hvhehrpd0gvxcx/aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXNpZ25waWNrbGUuY29tLw==
) is a lot cheaper than DesignJoy. Yet, it hit a run rate of
$21.1M in 2022 (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/reh8hoh03lqx4pt2/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZXRsYXRrYS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2Rlc2lnbnBpY2tsZQ==
) ‚Äì 16x more than Brett‚Äôs annual revenue. (But likely with 16x
more employees, as well...)

That said, here‚Äôs a roundup of the most in-demand digital skills
in 2023, according to Upwork. Take your pick‚Ä¶

)‚Äã
And for the skeptics who say you could never build a 7-figure
business off something as ‚Äúsilly‚Äù as social media marketing, we
recently covered an intern making $165k a month selling Canva
templates to realtors (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u9dm5r44cqhkwlqpdug/8ghqhohl26g9desk/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFudGhpbmtpbmcuY28vdHVybi15b3VyLWlnLW9ic2Vzc2lvbi1pbnRvLWEtNy1maWd1cmUtYnVzaW5lc3Mv
).

That should tell you that nothing is impossible.

Here‚Äôs to a little more riding and a little less driving today.

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,
One of the most underrated traits of a successful business buyer?

Efficiency.

It‚Äôs easy to lose momentum when you hit the slog of scouting leads, following up, hitting dead ends. Milestones are few and far between, and it can be tempting to rush negotiations or skimp on due diligence just so you can finally cross the finish line‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs a better way. It just takes adding a few simple processes to the origination stage of your biz-buying process.

By the way‚Ä¶ Do you want to know all 10 steps I use to buy cash-flowing businesses? You have a chance next week at my free, live Masterclass. Spots are limited, but readers of this newsletter are getting early access to sign-up today, at this link (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/10-steps-masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=june-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=32b24a8653&mc_eid=UNIQID) . (I‚Äôll be doing a real-time 30-minute Q&A at the end, so bring your biz questions!).

For today, let‚Äôs go over 5 systems that will streamline your deal search.


** In 5 minutes or less:
------------------------------------------------------------
* Set goals that won't make you sad
* Keep tabs on your deals like a boss
* Templatize communications
* Crush goals, metrically
* Channel your inner mortician


** 1. Set goals that won‚Äôt make you sad
------------------------------------------------------------

The most tempting metrics for acquisitions are revenue numbers or portfolio growth. The problem is, these goals can take MONTHS to get any traction.

When you‚Äôre in the throes of the acquisition search, there‚Äôs a lot of upfront hustle required just to get on a call with someone, much less to find a business that is a good fit for your portfolio.

Instead of being deflated by macro-growth (or lack thereof), it‚Äôs better to set weekly, measurable goals around the efforts of your dealmaking process.

Here‚Äôs a start:


** 2. Keep tabs on deals like a boss
------------------------------------------------------------

The early stages of finding prospective deals really is a numbers game. Building a deal tracker helps you win that game.

You'll likely find that you‚Äôre shuffling through dozens of potential leads, trying to figure out what your top priority is.

One way to keep your ducks in a row is to use a CRM tool, or even a simple spreadsheet (https://blog.toolsoncloud.com/2021/10/free-sales-lead-tracker-excel-template.html?mc_cid=32b24a8653&mc_eid=UNIQID) , to create a deal tracker. Keep tabs on who you‚Äôre talking to and the value of deals you‚Äôre working with at any given time.

Half the battle of dealmaking is getting visibility into your deal pipeline, so tracking your progress with potential leads is key. Plus, it gives you metrics around some of your repeatable tasks ‚Äì like how long it takes you to research, negotiate, and fully execute a deal ‚Äì that will help you get more efficient over time.

You can track whatever information is helpful for you, but there are a few items we think are non-negotiables‚Ä¶

A CRM tool can also help you set up automation to remind you when it‚Äôs time to follow up with your lead if they‚Äôve been unresponsive.

If you‚Äôre a real spreadsheet nerd, you could create a similar tracking system for keeping up with contacts in your network to lean on during the dealmaking process.


** 3. Templatize communications
------------------------------------------------------------

As you gain confidence with your dealmaking process, you‚Äôll want to create templates for as many repeatable tasks and communications as possible.

The art of personalization and building rapport has a valuable place in small business acquisition. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean every step needs a heart-warming personal touch.

You‚Äôll notice yourself typing up the same exact email, creating the same exact documents, and asking the same exact questions. Rather than re-inventing the wheel for every prospect, keep a bank of these templates to copy & paste.

A few template opportunities:

You should also document all repeatable tasks in an SOP to save you time (or so you can eventually outsource to a sales rep).


** 4. Crush goals, metrically
------------------------------------------------------------

Establish scorecard metrics for all prospective deals and track accordingly.

Our general rule of thumb for tracking metrics is: if you make an initial touchpoint with a potential deal (i.e. send an email, call the business, DM the owner, set up a meeting), then the deal should be tracked, even if it stalls out.

Here are some metrics we recommend gathering data around:

Setting quarterly goals around your metrics will not only help you stay organized and efficient, but you‚Äôll be able to predict and manage your capacity. If you‚Äôre looking to expand and scale faster, these numbers will also help you determine when you‚Äôre ready to hire a sales rep.


** 5. Channel your inner mortician
------------------------------------------------------------

It's an autopsy of sorts, but we‚Äôre still talking deals here.

Once you‚Äôve got the basics in place from above, the next thing you need to build is a post-mortem process for every, single, deal where you initiated a touchpoint.

But before we get into the how, let‚Äôs chat about the WHY.

First up, you want to make sure that your efforts are being spent on viable deals. We‚Äôre not here to waste time on low-quality leads, so a solid post-mortem will help you recognize the right leads from a mile away and source them better.

The more you can nail down what these qualities are for you, the faster you‚Äôll be at sourcing and seeing those patterns in future prospects.

Secondly, once you get an idea of what you like, it will make it easier for you to outsource the research and initial stages to sales reps.

Tracking helps you flag what you do and don't like. Here are a few ideas:

Want to spend LESS time chasing down bad deals and MORE time actually enjoying buying businesses in the boring?

Build systems to streamline your deals.

We‚Äôre in the business of businesses‚Ä¶ So treat even the search itself like you'd treat a biz.

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

If you know me, you know there are a couple things I‚Äôll never recommend.

No get-rich-quick stuff. No tech-y startup investments. No going all-in on crypto. No wiring your life savings to a Nigerian prince over email.

If you know me, you know I teach biz-buying as a path to financial freedom.

And if you really know me, you know I‚Äôll be hosting a free, live Masterclass tomorrow on the exact process I‚Äôve used to buy 20+ cashflowing businesses. I‚Äôm breaking down all 10 steps ‚Äì and to sweeten the deal, there‚Äôs also a live Q&A and a chance to win a $1,000 startup grant.

We‚Äôre getting dangerously close to our cap of 5k attendees (and 70k people receive this email), so now‚Äôs your last chance to secure your spot here (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/10-steps-masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=june-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=805b7ae2ab&mc_eid=UNIQID) .

This Masterclass will teach what businesses I most recommend, but let‚Äôs keep it real... Not all industries have built-in cashflow.

Today, let‚Äôs talk about 5 businesses I do NOT recommend buying.


** In 5 minutes or less:
------------------------------------------------------------
* This framework puts you a nautical mile ahead of other buyers
* Restaurants: A recipe for risk
* Retail: Death by e-commerce
* Amazon Selling: FBA ‚â† FWB
* Hotels: Real estate in disguise
* Dropshipping: Let's drop this idea


** This framework puts you a nautical mile ahead of other buyers
------------------------------------------------------------

Before I tell you what doesn‚Äôt work, let‚Äôs zoom in on two key frameworks that do work.

There‚Äôs a short, simple method I use to scan deals that cross my path ‚Äì SOWS. It stands for Simple, Old, Weak, and Stale. It‚Äôs a framework for finding businesses that not only cashflow but are ready to 10-20x their revenue.

* Stale: Biz's with that 90s feel to them‚Ä¶ An ancient website, no social media, maybe a fax machine. These have opportunity for cost savings and revenue growth via simple software that just hasn‚Äôt been added yet.

* Old: An old business has weathered recessions and proven cashflow and demand. If it‚Äôs been working, it‚Äôs likely to continue working.

* Weak: These biz‚Äôs are needs, not wants. No one desires to spend money on them, but you don‚Äôt have great alternatives. Think: the last time a home services company said they‚Äôd be by ‚Äúsometime between 8am and 2pm,‚Äù and then never showed up. That competition isn‚Äôt hard to beat.

* Simple: A business your grandma could understand. Pros to this: 1) You don‚Äôt need to be a specialist or hire one, and 2) You can scale up operations rapidly. But remember, simple ‚â† easy.



If SOWS is too much, we can distill it into an even simpler framework:

The Blue Ocean Strategy.

A ‚Äúblue ocean‚Äù is a segment in the market with little to no competition. This means less pricing pressure and higher profits for you. Differentiation is easy, and competition feels kinda like this:

Isn‚Äôt that nice?

Let‚Äôs keep this in mind while we dive into 5 businesses you shouldn't sail toward.


** 1. Restaurants: A recipe for risk
------------------------------------------------------------

What exists on every corner of every block in every city?

Somewhere to eat.

What does this mean for you? Constant competition you have to outperform and fight off.

This competition explains restaurants' 60% failure rate (https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/heres-the-real-reason-why-most-restaurants-fail.html?mc_cid=805b7ae2ab&mc_eid=UNIQID)  in their first year ‚Äì a number that jumps to 80% within the first 5 years.

And that's just the failure rate‚Ä¶ never mind the onslaught of other reasons why this industry is serving us some serious red flags when it comes to being a low-key passive income stream.

Not only do you have to worry about the latest Paleo gluten-free sandwich shop popping up across the street, but you also have to be concerned about Yelp reviews, staffing issues, and food shortages. Not to mention, the average profit margin for a restaurant is probably even worse than you thought (it‚Äôs between 3% and 5% (https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/average-restaurant-profit-margin?mc_cid=805b7ae2ab&mc_eid=UNIQID) ).

If you‚Äôre looking for an investment that gives you financial freedom, run far away (I don‚Äôt care how mean a pasta carbonara you can make ‚Äì buying a restaurant is not the way).


** 2. Retail: Death by e-commerce
------------------------------------------------------------

We're entering a 'retail apocalypse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_apocalypse?mc_cid=805b7ae2ab&mc_eid=UNIQID) '... which tells you all you need to know about investing in anything retail.

So, who‚Äôs responsible for Target‚Äôs version of Dawn of the Dead?

One word: Amazon.

The world of e-commerce has completely changed consumer behavior and ultimately shifted how we shop.

Why would you get off your couch when you can Prime literally whatever you need to your doorstep? Nothing turns on the everyday consumer quite like convenience and easy living.

In addition to a decreasing customer base, retail storefronts have high rents and a painful inventory cycle.

Similar to the restaurant industry, this sector is high-risk with some heavy competition. And it's greatly affected by economic conditions, so expect sales to tank when the economy is in the dumps.

Please pass on this one.


** 3. Amazon Selling: FBA ‚â† FWB (friends with Bezos)
------------------------------------------------------------

If you can't beat ‚Äòem, join ‚Äòem‚Ä¶ Right?

Wrong.

Sure, throwing products on your Amazon storefront may seem like a good idea in theory‚Ä¶ There's a ton of site traffic, and with Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon), you don't even have to worry about inventory.

Buuuuut, it's not all roses.

You're dealing with a highly saturated market, with tens‚Ä¶ sometimes hundreds of sellers for one product. You also have to consider the Buy Box score, which is Amazon's way of deciding if your product is the best fit for the consumer.

They're continually changing what determines a winning score, so you're also trying to crack the elusive Buy Box code.

Then you pay the hefty selling fees for each sale, especially if you opt-in to FBA. So, you have to make sure your margins are high enough to make any profit.

And finally, you can niche into a product that pays, play by all the rules of the ‚ÄòZon‚Ä¶ And they still have the power (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/comments/v80uha/your_amazon_seller_account_has_been_deactivated/?mc_cid=805b7ae2ab&mc_eid=UNIQID)  to shut it all down whenever they want.

There's a reason Jeff Bezos is the richest dude in the world. The same reason we don't advise you to add this type of biz to your portfolio.


** 4. Hotels: Real estate in disguise
------------------------------------------------------------

Hotels aren‚Äôt exactly businesses.

They‚Äôre real estate with a lot of moving parts masquerading as a business.

Hotels are at the mercy of all economic cycles. A successful hotel purchase is based more on timing than any other factor. Good guessing is never a solid foundation for any investment.

Many folks with real estate experience struggle with the service aspects of a hotel. But if your experience is in the service industry? It‚Äôs very easy to get over-leveraged with the real estate part.

At the end of the day:
* They're expensive to run.

* Cashflow isn't enough to cover the real estate transation.

* They‚Äôre the only business where customers require your help 24/7.


There's a better biz for you out there.


** 5. Dropshipping: Let's drop this idea
------------------------------------------------------------

Another TikTok get-rich scheme? Maybe.

Dropshipping is an order fulfilment method where an online retailer or business doesn't keep any inventory in stock. Instead, the seller purchases it from a third party.

This is comparable to Amazon FBA, where you don't have to worry about having product on hand as it's handled by the supplier.

That's great, but with three parties involved, things can get real complicated real quick.

All issues with the supplier are put on you, the middleman. This means customer complaints or problems in the supply chain are your responsibility, even though most are out of your control.

And the icing on top of an already not-so-great cake?

There are minimal profits to be made. Your income is limited because you need to buy products at a wholesale discounted rate for bulk orders. It's on a per-customer-demand basis.

Add in high shipping costs, and we're running as far and fast as we can.

Do you see what all these businesses have in common?

They‚Äôre oversaturated and complex. They‚Äôre flashy and, often, short-lived. Differentiation is hard to come by, and it drives profits down.

If the Blue Ocean Strategy was a test, these 5 businesses would have flunked.

This game is hard enough as-is. Let‚Äôs not make it harder than it needs to be.

Keep it simple, old, weak, and stale.

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

Name two more popular things in America right now than e-bikes and Boulder, CO.

I‚Äôll wait.

Not even peanut butter & jelly could rival how well Boulder and bikes go together.

Boulder has been repeatedly voted:
* The fittest city. (https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkg45efkii/1-boulder-colorado/?sh=3ff2af7716e3&mc_cid=dc80f67e2b&mc_eid=UNIQID)
* The biking-est city. (https://www.dailycamera.com/2014/05/15/number-of-boulder-workers-bicycling-to-work-17-times-higher-than-national-average/?mc_cid=dc80f67e2b&mc_eid=UNIQID)
* One of the best cities to visit. (https://travelboulder.com/new-travel-guide-highlights-makes-boulder-boulder/?mc_cid=dc80f67e2b&mc_eid=UNIQID)

So when our Mastermind member told us he just closed on his first acquisition and it was an e-bike touring company in Boulder, we knew we had to get the breakdown on this deal to share with you.

** How do you diversify when real estate isn't enough?
------------------------------------------------------------

Meet our friend Colin.

With no formal support, he had scrapped together a career real estate investing in the Denver area.

Fix & flip, buy & hold, Airbnbs, medium-term rentals, fully-furnished rentals ‚Äì Colin did it all.

That is, until 2020 when the Denver real estate market boomed. It became clear Colin couldn‚Äôt get sustainable ROI on future investments.

A career in RE was turning sour, but Colin had two young daughters he wanted to provide a good life for. So, he started taking matters into his own hands.


** Shifting gears: How to find the right biz
------------------------------------------------------------

For years, Colin was a window shopper on sites like BizBuySell. Maybe you‚Äôre familiar with the routine:

Find a listing for a cool business. Daydream about what it would be like to own a plumbing company that does $3M in revenue‚Ä¶ Then never do anything about it.

But in early 2023, he got real about his next career move. And business-buying it was.

When he started outlining his buy box, he thought about what he had experience with (ie, real estate and renting). So, he thought, maybe a home services biz?

One of the first companies he found was a flooring business. He poured hours into research, financials, and other due diligence, until he realized‚Ä¶

It just wasn‚Äôt for him.

The sales, the inventory, the showroom, the competition, the risk. It was all too daunting and too many moving parts for Colin‚Äôs first acquisition. So, one long DD process went down the drain.

But he wasn‚Äôt deterred, and one day he stumbled upon an unexpected biz that felt like a perfect match.

He‚Äôd already bought e-bikes for himself and his family, after all‚Ä¶


** What's 30% seller-financed, low overhead, and blue all over...?
------------------------------------------------------------

Colin signed the dotted line in early June with one emotion running through him:

Terror.

What did I get myself into?

It had been raining every day for the past week. This business is entirely weather-dependent. What if the whole summer is like this? What if no one booked a tour? What if he never made any revenue?

But his first day on the job, the clouds cleared ‚Äì both metaphorically and literally. Monsoon season ended abruptly, and the bookings steadily rolled in.

Let‚Äôs see just what he got himself into.


** The Deal Breakdown
------------------------------------------------------------

Business name: Boulder Tour Company

Type of company: E-bike tours

Purchase price: $220k

SDE: ~$90k

Cash down: $50k

Financing:
* $100k from a real estate investment
* $70k seller carry at 8% over 3 years

(Colin was grateful for these resources, and noted the importance of capital in a deal this size. The seller financing on this deal eased the burden, but he shared a simple truth for all aspiring acquisitionists: ‚ÄúYa gotta find the money somewhere.‚Äù)


** The Business Breakdown
------------------------------------------------------------

What‚Äôs all this bike business about? And how is he running this thing?
* Operations: The seller stayed on for a generous transition period, but Colin will be running the biz with his customer service rep, tour guides, and hopefully a few new hires.

* Hiring: Guides make $25/hr + tips. But hiring has proven tricky. The job is seasonal, part-time, and requires a lot of flexibility ‚Äì literally and figuratively. It takes a special kind of Boulderite to go with the flow when weather or customers cancel a tour, and also be willing to be out on a bike for full days at a time.

* $: Colin‚Äôs favorite part of this biz? The low overhead. It‚Äôs a relatively simple business model, with relatively few moving parts and low costs (~$300/month to charge the bikes, plus payroll and a little $ for transportation and storage). For tours, Boulder Tour Company charges $105 per rider, or $130 per rider for a private/corporate tour.

* The Bikes: The biz purchase came with 16 fat-tire, cruiser-style e-bikes, with batteries that can handle three tours per day.

They do 2-hour guided tours in a loop around Boulder, stopping at sites like Pearl Street Mall, Dushanbe Tea House, and CU Campus before they effortlessly cruise up the hill to Chautauqua Park for stunning Flatirons views.

* Next Steps: Colin inherited some pretty sweet marketing with these bright blue bikes and their online presence. His next steps are to expand marketing efforts, making connections at the university, local hotels, and other places tourists might find themselves in want of an ebike tour, as well as reaching out to corporate event planners and wedding planners.


** 3 tips from a marketplace lurker turned buyer
------------------------------------------------------------

Wait.

Didn‚Äôt we skip a crucial part of this story?

How did Colin go from a clicking king on BusinessesForSale.com to the kind of guy who actually submits an LOI?

The short answer: he got sucked into the Unconventional Acquisitions vortex.

When he heard about the UA Mastermind, his first reaction was suspicion. He‚Äôs a smart guy ‚Äì and after all, you can‚Äôt trust everything you hear on the internet.

But after learning more, he made a choice:

If I spend some money on learning this acquisitions thing, that‚Äôs accountability enough for me to finally get serious about it.

A few months in, his tune totally changed.

If I‚Äôd had something like this when I started in real estate, things would be different.

For Colin, the Mastermind was accountability and an education all in one. It's just what he needed to start turning dreams into reality.

There are 3 main takeaways Colin got from his biz-buying experience you may find helpful, wherever you are in your journey.


** 1. Realize what you‚Äôre buying.
------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, you could buy 30 e-bikes and start a biz like this from scratch. It would probably be cheaper.

But Colin knew that wasn‚Äôt what he was buying here. He was buying everything else. The reviews, the great reputation, the online presence, the strong branding, a high SEO ranking.

Remember: You‚Äôre buying a turnkey, operable business. All the work you didn‚Äôt have to do to build is baked into the price.


** 2. Having a great team is underrated.
------------------------------------------------------------

He immediately noticed a difference from real estate: the biz-buying process starts out as 2-vs-1.

Negotiations were the seller and the broker vs Colin.

It‚Äôs easy to lose confidence in a situation like that, which is why forming a team was a complete game-changer.

* Attorney: He got a recommendation for a lawyer from the Mastermind group. This person's insight completely changed the course of the deal, helping to turn it around.

* CPA: Once he brought in a competent CPA, Colin could breathe easier about the business. He'd felt it was good, but having a finance person confirm his suspicions helped seal the deal.

* Plot twist ‚Äì the seller! In Colin‚Äôs case, the seller proved to be a lynchpin ally in the deal. The guidance and rapport were vital.

Remember: The process shouldn‚Äôt feel like you vs the world. It‚Äôs worth the time and money to find good people you can trust.


** 3. Your family deserves a better life.
------------------------------------------------------------

Plain and simple.

Colin got into biz-buying as a way to provide the life he wanted for his family.

Remember: You can do it. You might have to do it scared. But do it.

****************************
Please DO NOT buy a business
****************************

‚Äã
Hey Contrarians,

Please, for the love of all that is holy, do NOT buy a business.

What? Codie, you literally won‚Äôt shut up about buying businesses?

Yes.

But I mean it, please don‚Äôt buy a business.

Let me explain‚Ä¶

‚Äã

------------------------------------------
Today in 10 minutes or less, you'll learn:
------------------------------------------

‚úîÔ∏è Contrarian framework: Opportunity vs Ease

‚úîÔ∏è My 2 rules for business-buying

‚úîÔ∏è What a bad deal looks like (ft. my worsts)

‚úîÔ∏è Bare minimum need-to-know terms to CYA as a business owner

‚úîÔ∏è The only circumstances where I‚Äôll let you buy a business

‚Äã

-----------------------------------------
Contrarian framework: Opportunity vs Ease
-----------------------------------------

Most people will never understand the pain and grit it takes to
be a business owner, founder, CEO, or head honcho.

Explaining it is like trying to explain why some humans choose to
be Navy SEALs. Why they claw through dirt and muck and sweat and
tears to pin on a gold trident.

Business is not war, but it sure can feel like a battle. The
thing is, we can‚Äôt all be Navy SEALs. But we can have ownership ‚Äì
or skin in the game ‚Äì of business. In fact, some of us are just
absolute psychopaths, so unemployable the only option is
entrepreneurship.

If you‚Äôre reading this, you may be one of those humans who
understands. But I want to make sure of one thing‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt mistake opportunity for ease.

There's a massive opportunity in biz-buying. A
generational-wealth-creating opportunity.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not work. That doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no
risk.

It‚Äôs only worth it if you are consistently good and consistently
work hard. That is what it takes, nothing more, nothing less.

‚Äã

------------------------------
My 2 rules for business-buying
------------------------------

There are really only two rules. But the thing is, they are
everything.

‚Äã

1. Don‚Äôt lose money.
--------------------

Warren Buffett famously said, ‚ÄúThe first rule of an investment is
don't lose [money]. And the second rule of an investment is don't
forget the first rule. And that's all the rules there are.‚Äù

We do not buy businesses as charity, though they can do good. We
buy them for cashflow.

* If the business is not profitable, we do not buy it.
* If we are not sure the business will keep being profitable, we
do not buy it.
* If we are not sure we understand the business and thus are not
sure if it‚Äôll be profitable, we do not buy it.

We do everything possible to follow rule #1.

‚Äã

2. Don‚Äôt buy a business that can bankrupt you.
----------------------------------------------

Please repeat back rule number one to me.

Then, let‚Äôs add the idea of existential threat.

Bankruptcy.

In my 15 years of buying businesses and 3,000 students going
through our education, I have only ever seen 1 person actually go
through bankruptcy from buying a business and 2 students flirt
with it. Their faces still haunt me. They knew the risks. They
were adults. They‚Äôd run businesses before.

Nine times out of 10, bankruptcy can be avoided. Yet, it CAN and
WILL happen again.

Business is a risk. A big one. And your very first job is DO NOT
LOSE MONEY, but especially do not run out of money entirely.
Every time you get excited about a deal, refer back to this
rule.‚Äã

Yeah, no sh*t we don‚Äôt want to lose money or go bankrupt
--------------------------------------------------------

That sounds awful. It‚Äôs no entrepreneur‚Äôs goal going in to lose
everything.

But how do we take risks, grow, and get in the arena without
losing our shirt?

Well, you can start here‚Ä¶

‚Äã

-----------------------------------------------------
Bare minimum need-to-know terms to CYA as a biz owner
-----------------------------------------------------

If you don‚Äôt know these terms, you aren‚Äôt ready to buy a business
yet.

If you don‚Äôt know these terms AND how to put them to use, you
aren‚Äôt ready yet.

Please read sentence 1 and sentence 2 again.

This isn‚Äôt to say you‚Äôre not smart, or you won‚Äôt be ready
someday. You just aren't ready yet. You need to learn these
things.

Then, if the song of freedom sings to you loud enough to cover up
the pain it takes to get it, you can buy a business.

This is the part where you turn your learning brain on:

* Business reporting terms: 13-week cashflow statement (and how
to use one), company scorecard, P&L, capitalization table, cash
burn rate or runway, EBITDA.‚Äã
* Personal finance terms: Net worth, accredited investor,
debt-to-assets ratio (and what yours is), cashflow, total liquid
assets. You also need to know all this info about a business
before you get within a mile of buying it.‚Äã
* Downside scenario planning: If a biz goes sideways, what your
worst-case scenario is (and how to create it).‚Äã
* ‚ÄãPayment terms (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxoroe6uz/qvh8h7hrv8mm8nblhk/aHR0cHM6Ly9xdWlja2Jvb2tzLmludHVpdC5jb20vci9ib29ra2VlcGluZy9jaG9vc2luZy1hbmQtZGVmaW5pbmctaW52b2ljZS1wYXltZW50LXRlcm1zLw==
): 50% upfront, installment agreements, lines of credit, CIA:
Cash in advance or immediate payment/payment due upon receipt
(when does the money hit your bank account?), PIA: Payment in
advance, Net 7, 10, 15, 30, 60, or 90: Payment expected within X
days after the invoice date, EOM: End of month, COD: Cash on
delivery, CND: Cash next delivery, CBS: Cash before shipment.‚Äã
* Due diligence terms: LOI, purchase agreement, operating
agreement, add-backs, break-up fee, data room, due diligence
questionnaire or checklist, guarantees, historical lawsuits.‚Äã
* Debt terms: Interest (variable vs fixed), SBA loans, debt
service ratio, warrants, buy-out provision, closings, debt
service cost, promissory notes, lines of credit.‚Äã
* Business operating terms: Budget, capacity planning, quality
assurance, supply chain, procurement.‚Äã
* Revenue: Did you know revenue is not actually one thing? It
could be couched in many ways, such as net revenue, net income,
gross revenue, gross income, profit, cashflow, SDE, owner‚Äôs
salary.‚Äã
* Investing terms: Fund term, investment period, LP, GP,
distribution waterfall, GP or LP clawbacks, catchups, capital
calls, in-kind distributions, management fees, closings, fund
expenses, gates, lockups.‚Äã
* Business acquisition terms: Key person provision, owner
transfer period, noncompete, indemnification, reporting,
financial reporting requirements, non-solicitation,
nondisclosure.

It‚Äôs a lot, but it‚Äôs necessary. Save this list, refer to it
often, learn until you have it all memorized. If you're not sure
where to start, this course (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxoroe6uz/g3hnh5h3ne88exhrh9/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb250cmFyaWFuLXRoaW5raW5nLnRoaW5raWZpYy5jb20vY291cnNlcy90aGUtaW52ZXN0b3Itb3BlcmF0aW5nLXN5c3RlbS1jb3Vyc2U=
) is a good option.

Then, you‚Äôll speak the language of money. And then, you‚Äôll be a
step closer to smarter deals.

But terminology doesn‚Äôt tell you everything‚Ä¶

‚Äã

----------------------------
What‚Äôs a Bad Deal Look Like?
----------------------------

Ya know what a raccoon looks like, right? Black and white
striped, tiny hands, oddly cute yet highly feral.

You will develop that same instant recognition for bad deals.
Let‚Äôs break down some of my stripey ones.

I‚Äôve had three deals go bad in our groups (that I‚Äôm aware of),
and I‚Äôve had 4 deals go bad for myself. You can learn from all of
them.

Want to know what happened?

Others‚Äô Deals:
--------------

* Deal #1: 1st-time construction company‚Äã‚ùå Never brought the
final deal to the group to review. Never got an industry expert
to review it. Used all own cash, no seller financing. Bought a
deal not near him. Moved states and quit his job to do it.‚Äã‚Äã
* Deal #2: 1st-time restaurant‚Äã‚ùå Never brought the final deal to
the group to review. Bought a restaurant. Bought an unprofitable
business. Brought on a 50/50 partner with unvested equity who
brought no cash then bailed on them. Bought a declining
franchise. Bought in another state.‚Äã‚Äã
* Deal #3: 1st-time trucking company‚Äã‚ùå Never brought the final
deal to the group to review. (Noticing a pattern with the fails
of our Mastermind (
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxoroe6uz/9qhzhnhpxgvvg4u9h3/aHR0cHM6Ly91bmNvbnZlbnRpb25hbGFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy5jb20vbWFzdGVybWluZC8=
) members? It happens when they don‚Äôt use the f-ing Mastermind.
Ugh.) Used all own cash. Moved states and quit job to do it.
Never got an equipment valuation. Didn‚Äôt have full set of
financials. Didn‚Äôt do a 50% downside protection plan.‚Äã

MY Deals:
---------

* Deal #1: E-commerce brand‚Äã‚ùå Bought an unprofitable business.
Had an operator who put no cash in. Operated in a different
state. Didn‚Äôt bring in an industry expert. Used all cash, no
seller financing.‚Äã‚Äã
* Deal #2: CPG brand‚Äã‚ùå Bought an unprofitable business. Didn‚Äôt
require weekly/monthly financial reporting. Bought in another
state.‚Äã‚Äã
* Deal #3: Service business‚Äã‚ùå Bought an only-slightly-profitable
business. More like a job than a business. Not enough cash to
hire a great operator. No time to do it myself. Just coasting on
empty basically.‚Äã
* Deal #4: Home service business‚Äã‚ùå Bought an
only-slightly-profitable business. Kind of let myself get guilted
into the deal by knowing the operator well. Bought in another
state. Operator not tested. Three partners in the deal (two too
many).‚Äã

Note: You can have all of these things exist in the business
you‚Äôre buying and still win.

But damn do you have better odds if you just start with a better
deal.

(Want to know what a good deal looks like? I‚Äôve got a massive
list coming at you in next week's newsletter for EVERYTHING you
need to know to make your first deal great‚Ä¶ So you better make
sure you‚Äôve got this thing in your primary inbox, you‚Äôre not
gonna want to miss it.)

‚Äã

--------------------------------------------------------
The only circumstances where I‚Äôll let you buy a business
--------------------------------------------------------

Can you confidently answer these questions?

I think business buying and building gets overcomplicated, but it
really comes down to two things:

1) Does it make money?

Does the business make money, enough of it, consistently, to the
level you need, with little chance it‚Äôll stop, and enough to
handle inevitable problems‚Ä¶

And if yes‚Ä¶

Are you sure?‚Äã

2) GWD Framework: Get it. Want it. Do it.

Well-synthesized by Will Fry, a business broker at Beacon, who
has a great Twitter thread on it. These three questions stand
out:

* Do you Get it? (What the biz is & does.)
* Do you Want it? (Do you want to do those things, and run this
business.)
* Can you Do it? (Are you capable even if you want to do it.)

(
https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/v8ul6zn2eetrhxoroe6uz/3ohphkh7rq55q0trhn/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9CdXlTZWxsU01CL3N0YXR1cy8xNjA0ODY0MjY1MzU3MjQ2NDY3
)‚Äã
That said, inside these questions is a world of information. It‚Äôs
why I obsess on sharing and distributing all I can about business
buying.

‚Äã

---------------
Final takeaways
---------------

I hope this scares you a bit.

It shouldn‚Äôt make you run away from ownership, but it should make
you respect the hell out of the process. Dealmaking and buying
small businesses is not easy. It can be simple, but it is not
easy.

YOU have to do the work up-front to create the life, legacy,
income, and business you desire. I happen to believe anyone can
start and run a business, but only with the right:

Knowledge + Desire + Pain Tolerance

But I also know most people won‚Äôt do the hard. Most people will
cut corners. Most people will say their due diligence is ‚Äúgood
enough,‚Äù or they can figure it out later.

You, my Contrarian, will not be most people.

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

Today I want you to hear from my good bud Romeen.

Romeen (twitter.com/RomeenSheth) scaled his business to $60M before exiting to a private equity firm, and he‚Äôs one of the sharpest guys I know when it comes to boring businesses. Later this year, he‚Äôll be speaking at my conference about building a big time business.

For now, let‚Äôs get a preview on his insights for building and scaling an empire‚Ä¶


** In 5 minutes or less:
------------------------------------------------------------
* Meet Romeen
* Mental model: Are you building a grape or a watermelon?
* The 5 Stages of Growth: $0 to $100M


** Meet Romeen
------------------------------------------------------------

As Codie mentioned, I‚Äôve built a bootstrapped business to over $60M in revenue and exited to a private equity firm.

The most common question I get from aspiring entrepreneurs:

‚ÄúHow do you build a big business?‚Äù

There are endless details to share, but the most important thing I‚Äôve learned comes down to adhering to 1 mental model and 1 tactical framework.

Let‚Äôs jump in.


** Mental model: Are you building a grape or a watermelon?
------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm a firm believer that there is a single universal truth when you build a company:

You can solve for money or power, but you can‚Äôt solve for both.

Most people that build companies say they want money, impact, and scale. But in actuality? A lot of them use business as their mechanism to yield power.

There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with that, to be clear. But there is a big limitation that you quickly come to realize if business is your vehicle to exert power. Scale is inversely correlated with control.

If you‚Äôre obsessed with control and power, then that will be the gating factor to how big of a business you can build.

I share a mental model with entrepreneurs thinking through step function opportunities for their business. Any move where you need to principally share in the economics can be directionally assessed with a simple question:

Do you want the whole grape or a slice of the watermelon?

If you decide on the grape, it‚Äôs all yours. You can pluck it from the vine, fit it in your hand, and pop it in your mouth. You are in control every step of the way. But it‚Äôs tiny.

On the flipside, if you pick the watermelon, it‚Äôs not all yours. You will get a piece, but you need a knife and cutting board to slice it up; since you have to share it, you have to do so in a way that accommodates others as well. Although you only have a single piece, that piece is much bigger than the individual grape.

So how do you make sure that watermelon grows into something worth sharing?


** The 5 Stages of Growth: $0 to $100M
------------------------------------------------------------

There are 5 stages of growth in the journey to a $100M business.

It‚Äôs critical you‚Äôre an expert in each stage before progressing to the next. It‚Äôs also critical that you have a team that is the right fit for each of these stages.


** $0-1M: Do the damn thing
------------------------------------------------------------

You can grow most small businesses to ~$1M of revenue through solo execution.

At this stage, your singular focus should be identifying a business opportunity, getting started, finding customers, and servicing them well.

You can surround yourself with a handful of teammates, but you could get a business to this stage with pure willpower.


** $1-10M: Establish the core team
------------------------------------------------------------

Only 9% of businesses in the US get past $1M in revenue. The main reason, in my opinion, is because it takes a completely different skillset to grow past $1M than to get to $1M.

You need to learn how to hire, delegate, train and operationalize.

If you haven‚Äôt hired before, you will make mistakes. Focus on hiring in low-risk, incremental ways vs. wholesale disruption.

An easy exercise for this is The $1,000/hr Test. Document everything you do, and put a ‚Äúdollar per hour‚Äù value against each task. You‚Äôre likely doing a mix of $10/hour work and $1,000/hour work. At this level, you have to offload all lower-level work.


** $10-25M: Work IN the business
------------------------------------------------------------

This is when you start to enter the ‚Äúreal business‚Äù club.

This stage is all about standardizing how you operate. Every process should be written down, and the people that are on your team must have the capability to hire and train.

It‚Äôs one of the toughest zones in business ‚Äì you will consistently feel under-resourced and overstretched. The way to break past this feeling is through strong operations. Focus your time and energy on ensuring everything in the business (from back office to mid-office to front office) is dialed in.


** $25-50M: Work ON the business
------------------------------------------------------------

In this stage, you need to take a step back from working in the business. Now you just work on the business.

Your sole job at this stage should be to set the strategy for scale and hire great talent to help you execute. Fire yourself from any roles you have in the business, and replace it with a specialist hire.


** $50M-100M: Institutionalize the biz
------------------------------------------------------------

This zone is really interesting. Personally, I‚Äôm in it right now.

My sole focuses as an operator now are:
1. M&A
2. Large-scale partnerships & customers
3. Hiring key members on my executive team.

At this stage, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll have investors and executives who are much better and more experienced than you at an individual function. This is good.

Succeed at this, and you have an eco-system that will take you to new heights.

Each tactical stage in a business is different. It requires a different skillset and focus. Most importantly though, each of these stages are consistent with the Power vs. Money mental model.

Grape-eaters stay under $1M. Whenever in doubt, remind yourself that a slice of a watermelon is a hell of a lot juicier.

Onwards,

Romeen

Business buyers taking action

Hey Biz-Buyers,

On average, it takes anywhere between 6 months and several years (https://dealroom.net/blog/guide-to-acquiring-a-company?mc_cid=c140e6bc4f&mc_eid=UNIQID#:~:text=How%20Long%20Does%20it%20Take,a%20year%20(sometimes%20longer).) to close on a business purchase.

It‚Äôs a perfectly respectable amount of time ‚Äì considering most people go their whole lives without acquiring a business.

After all, in that span of time you have to learn the acquisitions game, source and complete due diligence on several deals, negotiate, structure financing, and prepare yourself for business ownership. A year is more than reasonable.

But not for Miguel.

He put the ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù in Unconventional Acquisitions.

He closed in under 4 months.

How do you become such a fast acter?

** How this story starts
------------------------------------------------------------

I think you deserve to know a detail from the beginning of this story‚Ä¶

Before joining our community, Miguel attended our free Masterclass.

This week, you have the same opportunity.

Hosted live by yours truly, I‚Äôll be going over the exact framework I‚Äôve used to buy my cashflowing businesses. Plus, you can ask me questions in a live Q&A and get a chance at a $1,000 startup grant.

We‚Äôre getting close to our cap of 5k attendees‚Ä¶ And this email goes out to 75k people. So secure your spot here ASAP (https://products.unconventionalacquisitions.com/10-steps-to-cashflow-masterclass?utm_source=ua-newsletter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=july-masterclass&utm_content=register&mc_cid=c140e6bc4f&mc_eid=UNIQID) !


** What comes after 15 years of corporate life?
------------------------------------------------------------

Before buying a multi-million dollar business, or ever hearing about UA, Miguel had a 15+ year career in none other than‚Ä¶

Corporate reinsurance.

So impressively boring it‚Äôs almost comical.

Miguel has worked at some of the biggest names in reinsurance, exceled in multiple roles, traveled the world for his work, and shifted companies several times. But‚Ä¶

He still felt stuck in a hamster wheel, thinking each new promotion or company switch might offer a big change. Instead, it ended up being more of the same. ‚ÄúCorporate is corporate,‚Äù after all.

Tired of running in circles, Miguel decided to step off the hamster wheel at the end of last year.

First, he looked into real estate (let‚Äôs be real: like everyone). But with interest rates up and prices not dropping in his market, real estate didn‚Äôt feel like a good avenue.

But if not real estate, then‚Ä¶


** What‚Äôs this market‚Äôs opportunity?
------------------------------------------------------------

Not long after deciding RE was a no-go, Miguel stumbled upon the concept of boring businesses.

It just made sense.

10,000 boomers are retiring daily. 19% own small businesses. The majority of these biz‚Äôs are successful, profitable operations that are simply lacking buyers.

It seemed the obvious path‚Ä¶ Right?


** Classy & Glassy: The Boring Biz Breakdown
------------------------------------------------------------

After deciding to pursue acquisitions in early April, Miguel buckled in for a predicted six-month search to find his first biz to consider buying.

Surprise:

By June 1, he was ready to sign on a biz.

But the actual signing was‚Ä¶ A bit anticlimactic. ""At least when you buy a house, you get a key!"" he noted.

Ever bought incredibly expensive concert tickets several months in advance that could get cancelled at any moment with no hope of a refund?

That‚Äôs a sliver of how it feels to wire $200k+ for a business you‚Äôve yet to operate.

But when he stepped into his shop for the first time as the new owner, the reality of his decision hit home.


** The Deal Breakdown
------------------------------------------------------------

Business name: Shower Doors of Nashville

Type of company: Shower door installation & custom glass

Time to close: <4 months

Multiple: 3.93x

Cash down: ~$200k

Financing:
* 80% seller financed
* No SBA loan

Want to negotiate your own seller financed deal? Take a page from Miguel‚Äôs book. He gave the seller two options:

1) If you want to close this deal next year, I‚Äôll use an SBA loan.

2) If you want to get it closed now, we‚Äôll have to do a seller note.


** The Business Breakdown
------------------------------------------------------------

How does one successfully take over a shower door installation business when one‚Äôs background is in reinsurance tech? Let‚Äôs check out Miguel‚Äôs game plan.
* Transition: How do you get an owner to sell you their business in ~4 months? It‚Äôs deceptively simple: make them keen to sell to you.
Our buyer did this through attentiveness. He really listened when the seller talked about his business, his employees, himself. As a result, the deal terms included the seller staying on for a 3-month transitionary period to show Miguel the ropes.

* Operations: Of course, this killer find came with a new challenge ‚Äì balancing a W2 job with running an enterprise he had zero expertise in. Coming from a financial background, he understood the numbers, but navigating the home services sector was a totally new experience.

For now, Miguel is the primary operator, but he knows he‚Äôll need to hire someone else before expanding his portfolio and jumping to Business 2 and 3. We tend to prefer buying biz's with an existing operator‚Ä¶ But ya gotta respect the willingness to get his hands dirty and learn his new business from the inside out.

* Some self-reflection: Shower Doors of Nashville specializes in (you guessed it) shower doors, but they also offer services for mirrors and other custom glass needs.
When the techs discuss challenging installs‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs gibberish to Miguel. Managing technical teams with little to no technical knowledge is a skill. Luckily, it's one of Miguel's strongest that he carries over from his career.

* Next steps: Step 1 for Miguel? If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. He knows his techs are good, and a dose of humility can be the best thing a new owner can offer a thriving business.
Step 2 will come later down the road: Find the systems that can be improved, make life easier for his employees, then stay out of their way.


** 3 lessons from these 4 months
------------------------------------------------------------

Knowledge is power. A few key takeaways from Miguel‚Äôs biz-buying journey:


** 1. YOU know yourself.
------------------------------------------------------------

When he embarked on this journey, he knew one thing: he can make sunk cost fallacy work for himself.

He signed up for a several-hundred-dollar a month gym membership and personal trainer‚Ä¶ Because knew it would motivate him to get fit.

Similarly, he joined our Mastermind‚Ä¶ because he knew spending money to invest in the biz-buying dream was the only way to motivate himself to get it done.

You know what motivates you. You know what support you need. You know what personal investments are ""worth it.""


** 2. BUT‚Ä¶ You don't know what you don't know.
------------------------------------------------------------

At first, the Mastermind was an accountability tool for Miguel. Until it hit him: This buying businesses thing isn‚Äôt as simple as he thought.

The Dunning Kruger Effect comes for the best of us. Come on, how hard could this be?

Then you start learning about sourcing, brokering, negotiating, LOIs, due diligence, deal structuring, and all the teeny tiny steps that go into buying a business.

You don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. And you won‚Äôt know you don‚Äôt know without education, mentorship, or a couple painful fails under your belt.


** 3. Know what you've bought
------------------------------------------------------------

By the time you sign the dotted line, you should have a clear idea of what you're buying. And what you need to do next.

Bought a clunker that still manages cashflow? Let‚Äôs jump in and make some obvious revenue-inducing improvements.

Bought a profitable, well-oiled machine? Let‚Äôs take Miguel‚Äôs approach: Don‚Äôt. Change. Anything. No need to come in and clean house.

Learn from what‚Äôs working.

Feel like you‚Äôre stuck on the hamster wheel? Not only can you jump off‚Ä¶ You can set the whole damn thing on FIRE.

Sip on this: The SODA Framework

When it comes to acquisitions, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of buying yourself a more tedious job than you had while working for someone else.

If you‚Äôre a new biz owner, we‚Äôve got two tips for working ON your biz instead of IN it‚Ä¶

One, grab yourself a nice, ice-cold glass bottle of Coke. Two, get yourself familiar with the SODA framework:

- S - Streamline
- O - Outsource
- D - Document
- A - Automate

Nothing helps new owner-operators understand a biz faster than wearing all the hats. But as time goes by, it‚Äôs vital you become a delegator and channel your energy toward owner-level duties.

Two of our favorite tips for figuring out what to outsource:

- The ‚Äú$1,000 an Hour‚Äù Rule (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VXfYtK1k8n69W4hX1RN2xljJCW2bnPc754sT9RN5bb0jz3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3njW6cg_lh3y7Q4_W4jQQwn980WqLN1RBc3gwPV_NW4vj24l1WdVGnW78Pxx18Yj3z9V1TfMZ5lGqMtVGKPpl8hfrLSN92VrNJT8B_KW3ps2Cb5J8pmzW35m-tv1W5p24VM1nNT9kZW-vW2XZmsX6T_rHQW1g9GzJ5VQ5QBW4-0cpP4jHpHLVT-6mW8Gt8jNMn1ckjlY_hGW4bCdPc5ZKqh7W4KlXb58cFVJ3N2v_6l2v_8C6W4c0qqs5tpgQ_Vb9MdZ5Lhm5LW2_0JHf6_fGykW8rwcjM75zRwBW3lDF315ZjfXXW7y9TqG1lLGCHW67PGNP1BfMJtW6LyDs42yRS1LW8FwyyL3bJlDJf8PDHn004 )

How to fast-track your financial literacy

The ability to read, write, and talk about finances is the foundation of financial well-being.

Many biz-buyers don‚Äôt come from finance backgrounds, and some in our community have recently started asking for more resources to help them learn the language of money üëá

Biz-buyers should be comfortable quickly analyzing figures on a spreadsheet and talking numbers with sellers, brokers, and each other.

So for starters, our facilitator Chris Petkas shared these recs:

Checklist before you start a deal search

They say luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, and it‚Äôs safe to say this biz-buying community member knows that through and through üëá

According to Josh, ‚ÄúAlmost all brokers or deal gatekeepers (aside from owners themselves) have asked me the following questions in some fashion:

- How soon are you looking to purchase?
- What industry are you interested in buying in?
- How are you funding the purchase? SBA, personal funds, investor funds?
- How much liquid capital do you have access to in 90 days for a down payment?
- What is your preferred purchase price range?
- SDE/EBITDA min/max?
- Who on your team has industry experience?

I‚Äôve written out my answers to these questions and I refer to it often!‚Äù

But wait, there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ Consider these extra additions, from another member:

- What cities or regions are you interested in?
- Are any of your financing sources pre-approved?
- Have you run a business before? If so, tell me about the business and industry.

Take notes, people. This is the good stuff.

Boring biz listings

Sourced from BizBuySell

1. üñºÔ∏è Longtime sign franchise

Bio: Located in MA, est. in 2001

Financials: $275k asking price, $123.9k cash flow

Deets: $453.3k gross revenue, $93k FF&E

Let‚Äôs think: There‚Äôs a lot to like in this listing for a ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù sign franchise. That includes this biz claiming to be ‚Äúthe only‚Äù sign biz in Cape Cod. The shop also comes ready with equipment, leased real estate, and comprehensive training from the franchisor and current owner. Plus, it hasn‚Äôt even been ‚Äúaggressively marketed.‚Äù Sure, you‚Äôll have to consider the fact that it‚Äôs a franchise, but... Could this be your sign to sell signs?

2. üöó Tire, car wash, and self-storage biz

Bio: Located in NC, est. in 1987

Financials: $1.625M asking price, $240k cash flow

Deets: $60k EBITDA, $850k real estate, $280k FF&E

Let‚Äôs think: By the looks of it, with this biz, you‚Äôre basically getting seven boring biz‚Äôs in one: A tire shop, a car wash, air pumps, vending machines, vacuums, change machines, and a 78-unit self-storage facility. Plus, real estate is included in this retirement-driven sale, as is buyer training. Still, with all these moving parts, thorough due diligence is needed and you‚Äôll have to be careful not to overextend yourself across all new skill sets.

3. üöú Farm & landscaping equipment biz

Bio: Northeast US, est. in 1956

Financials: $2.225M asking price, $973.5k cash flow

Deets: $6.95M gross revenue, $1M EBITDA, $178k FF&E

More deets: $2.57M inventory and $1.2M real estate not included

Let‚Äôs think: Here we‚Äôre looking at a profitable farm, landscaping, and construction equipment dealer and service provider. By equipment, we‚Äôre talking tractors, snow blowers, riding movers, generators, bush hogs, rototillers, aerators, power rakes, spreaders, sprayers, rollers, and more. For all the heavy metal, though, heavy due diligence will have to be conducted, especially given the location isn‚Äôt even publicly provided, the biz employs 17 people, and the real estate isn‚Äôt included.

‚úîÔ∏è In the weeds: Post-sale owner retention strategies

‚úîÔ∏è Grab bag: 16 resources members are sharing

‚úîÔ∏è 5 links from the week in biz-buying

How would you grow a butcher biz? This member has some ideas...

First, let us assure you, that while this segment is about a butcher biz, the lessons are relevant for carnivores and vegetarians alike. Cool? Cool.

So one of our members recently started looking into buying a butcher biz üëá

Now, before he even got into the deets, another member chimed in recommending some sharp due diligence questions you might find interesting, like:

- Do they have partnerships with restaurants locally?
- What's the local culture around it?
- How many different farms supply the meats?
- Like a restaurant, your inventory expires. Are you comfortable with that kind of risk?
- Would you eventually acquire a baker and candle stick maker too?

... And, importantly, ""I wonder how to expand or grow that type of business.""

So here's what the butcher hunter had to say about his plans for growing the biz and fitting it into his lifestyle as an owner:

- Growth strategy: ""Online sales would be the main push for expansion. Develop a meat club with events and a subscription model.""
- Life strategy: ""This type of biz plugs into the second phase of my life regarding buying land and starting a small-scale farming enterprise in livestock."" (How cool is that?!)

Now, if he were to go ahead and buy into this butcher biz, here are some other ""growth"" ideas we have to offer:

-

Meat Raffle Mondays: Host a weekly Monday raffle where customers can win different cuts of meat. (We can already see it: ""Don't be a chicken ‚Äì join the raffle!"")

-

Steak Selfies: Encourage customers to take a selfie with their favorite cut of steak, share it on social media, and tag the shop to win a free steak.

-

Meat & Greet: Host a monthly event where local farmers, customers, and perhaps a cow can come together to sample beef and schmooze.

In the weeds: Post-sale owner retention strategies

If you've ever looked into buying a small biz, you know a key factor of any acquisition can be the transitionary period in which an old owner trains a new one.

But sometimes that period is just way too short. So, one of our members is rightfully curious about how to make it longer and more effective üëá

As always, the community stepped up to lend some advice. Here's what they had to say:

From a member...

""What is the skill set of the seller? Sales, operations, or client relations? Based on the answer you could develop some incentives based on the metrics used to measure their success.""

From one of our facilitators...

""Have you had a conversation with the owner to see if this is something they would be interested in? Personally, I'd only consider upside if they did something that helped grow the business, which means they have to work a bit and they might not want to do that. I'd throw the idea out there and if they are interested then come up with possibilities.""

He added that it's important to focus on identifying the specific challenges you're facing as a new owner during this period. In this case, those were:

-

The need to retain key employees, as losing them would be detrimental to the business and likely result in a loss of revenue.

-

The opportunity to grow revenue, and having the owner assist would make that easier.

Once you do that, then you can focus on developing retention offers accordingly.

Hey Contrarians,

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to invest with us, this email is for you. (It‚Äôs also time-sensitive, so read it as soon as you can.)

So, I talk a lot about owning and investing in small, boring businesses. Last year though, we saw a different opportunity to layer in. One with even bigger potential: Launching a venture capital fund called Contrarian Thinking Capital (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VW5tWw7YfjgnW2wtD4g3szZvVVQq14555n5stN5ZDtV83pyd0W7Y8-PT6lZ3pSVv3FhH2mvKw4W8rRK-X94H3_DN3rYwYCXTr3lW6RfQdM6r0ckCW2_CdQR2xbPHzV4mmjG1w87scW77JhlB6KjPBMW2t736q7TW8CMW52Y6Nk4vg61gVs2mcB6ytSdhN9gnZ2xYNKV2W63DbTG1sPv-gW8NNZv8760Gq-W8WBZcG5jzHg2V9vcH37F0XPyW8V8xn883nd_1W4SxLMS7fLFD1W2M_y_l6jZJ9tW5Vj7WC3RW3LRW3TCklB3nVVs2W8z2rSp6PLWm-W2NTy_d59KmkvN7Y5jwBYS11kW21M_t45rB4xRVLy_YG6swS9ZN7lR9nD3-lGMf3ZhzGT04 ) .

The goal? To also invest (with YOU) in the startups powering tech evolutions across small business, investing, freedom, and more. Think car wash + modern software (wink wink, Shopgenie).

Boring businesses for not-so-boring returns. It‚Äôs all part of our master plan. Today we have updates on our progress and, possibly for the last time, details on how some of you can be involved in the next step...

TLDR: What you should know

I‚Äôm just gonna sum everything up for you right here: Our fund is raising an additional ~$5M and we‚Äôd love to see some of you invest if eligible. (Either way, this email should be a cool inside look into what we‚Äôve been up to.)

Since we launched the fund last year, we‚Äôve partnered with 16 tremendous founders and their startups (now collectively valued at $1.2B+). We‚Äôve also confirmed that there‚Äôs a massive opportunity in ‚Äúboring‚Äù tech with a small biz focus that we‚Äôre uniquely positioned to capitalize on (more on that in a bit).

This capital will allow us to support more founders building for the next generation, especially those making a difference for small biz‚Äôs and their employees.

So feel free to check out the fund website (and fill out the ‚Äúinvest now‚Äù prompt if you know you‚Äôre interested), then come back to learn about our secret weapons, growing portfolio, and the details and risks involved in investing in this fund.

Background: Media + Money + Machines + Small Biz

Between myself, our media, and our biz-buying community, I‚Äôve seen two trends happening across small biz acquisitions:

- Retiring business owners are increasingly trading hands with the next generation.
- As the next gen takes over, they‚Äôre bringing tech with them.

To me, tech + boring + 33M small biz‚Äôs (many of which will soon sell) = BIG opportunity.

At Contrarian Thinking, our goal isn‚Äôt just to invest in the laundromats, cleaning companies, and car washes of the world (and educate others on how to do the same).

We want to invest in the people building tech that takes these biz‚Äôs to the next level. The companies so innovative, that either their direct or indirect impacts on Main Streets can be truly profound.

By risking capital for these startups, we get a chance to own a piece of the future that may power businesses we love. We get a chance to have more skin in the game.

(And for the next couple of weeks, you might have a chance, too‚Ä¶)

Our secret weapons: You‚Äôre one of them

In a world where capital is a commodity, we have an unfair advantage. For starters, we do 3 things differently than most early-stage investors I see:

1) We‚Äôre building a top independent media and education brand in the small biz investing space. That means we can often assist with access to a top-of-funnel audience, small biz expertise, and even customers. Companies, top-tier VC‚Äôs, and other investors recognize this, too, and we‚Äôve attracted impressive inbound deal flow as a result.

2) We find the beauty in the rough and boring. We prefer getting our hands dirty looking at the opposite of social apps, crypto, and the next tulip bubble. We aren‚Äôt looking for flashy PR stunts, we‚Äôre looking for profit-driven companies that quickly refine, commit, and deliver.

3) We think like owners, not venture capitalists. That‚Äôs because we are owners working on our own businesses, too. We know growth is paramount, but not at all costs. When we structure deals, we try to coordinate for additional upside based on the value we deliver.

Alright, and with that, it‚Äôs time. Drumroll, please‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs our portfolio to date. 16 companies. Some are already profitable. The cool part about this is that if you invest in this fund (which we‚Äôre about to tell you is open), these companies are already in the portfolio.

How we invest (in plain English)

Here‚Äôs the thing about VC. It‚Äôs a totally different animal than investing in a small biz. To close a fund in the green, you can‚Äôt focus on reliable base hits. You need a couple of grand slams and it takes some time.

So here‚Äôs what we look for...

There‚Äôs no perfect formula, but if I had to list out what we tend to go after, it would be a company that:

- Isn‚Äôt just an idea. It has a product with months of data (at least).
- Has founders who have lived the problem they‚Äôre solving.
- Has a well-rounded team across tech and business operations.
- Has some funding already committed.
- Has a clear plan for how they‚Äôll deploy the capital.
- Can point to specific metrics highlighting traction and growth.
- Is on track for $100K to $10M in annual recurring revenue.
- Has a large or growing total addressable market (TAM) and is building products to solve issues that have pervaded small businesses or ‚Äúboring‚Äù industries.

Typically, we look to back founders raising equity at the pre-seed or seed levels, with our check sizes varying but usually ranging from $100k to $250k. Depending on the team, traction, and lead investors, we‚Äôll occasionally invest in later rounds.

We also reserve some capital for secondary investments in companies that have established product-market fit. (This would have included opportunities like Pipe, Robinhood, and Homebase, and yes, I am still kicking myself for not investing because they were too late stage.)

Now my favorite part: How you can be involved

When we first opened this fund, we opened the door to those of you eligible to come along for the ride. Now, after our first 16 investments, we‚Äôre swinging that door open again. Some quick notes:

- You must be an accredited investor. Here‚Äôs what that means (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VW5tWw7YfjgnW2wtD4g3szZvVVQq14555n5stN5ZDtSH5n4LbW50kH_H6lZ3m9W3wBFmz967snhW6xlLtQ4fq0z7W80llfg9ktC4QW6v8QP94-rlNjN78wqlm8BN29W6-SHDJ89bGHnW5qkc2V3_cfvyW8JMwkb349Cm4W8XDhVn6x9PKXW5TZt_F8GdbgWW1-8Wn14T8sXVW5BFQST7kD9wKV34N5641QntbW1CksLl3Znvj-W52MXWS3dtZ53W6frsmb4JSNJCW6yWJyk39FWhjW7rjgbh2X1C9MW6KY-yl3-mty8W6fb5by360jR3W8Bpbk0828dm8W2WrTM36bms16W8wGQ2b6vZkc1W362Xjd4Gzbt1W5tDW7F7N4g9NW14gBjc20cq6PV2DQMr1JmQDpN11pqBsgxypcW4hBP6-2pfGgtW7Tm0101pv5WtW6G-rMn4s4MqNW8fRm073m5JMfdBdQW404 ) ‚Ä¶
- 20% net carry: Carry is earned only if the fund is profitable.
- The minimum Commitment is $50k over 2 years but you will be prompted for 75% of your investment upfront ($37,500).
- The fund has a 2% management fee (2% annually over 10 years).
- We will close the door for commitments as soon as the fund target is met. First come first served. We‚Äôre raising a relatively small amount (~$5M), so we expect this to close fast.

üö® The Adult Section üö® Investments can go to zero, and surely some of them will. We‚Äôre making long-term bets on the future of SMBs, the economy, technology, and consumer behavior. Expect us to do everything we can to pick companies we think will win.

Venture capital is a potentially rewarding long-term game. We‚Äôre looking for long-term people. If you want to learn more about the fund and get involved, head on over to our website by clicking the button below. Once you‚Äôre there, select ‚ÄúInvest Now.‚Äù

I signed off with this when we launched the fund last year, and my message hasn‚Äôt changed:

‚ÄúI structured this in a way where I know that in 5, 10, 15, and 20 years from now I‚Äôll still want to be betting on the future of business owners to make our world better. This selfishly is where I want to put my money.

After all, ownership is the key to wealth, I hope to open the doors to becoming an owner to more humans. I hope to help bring more companies we want to exist to our audience and to the world, one tiny little check at a time. üôÇ

And for our founders, I hope to beat you up if you get ridiculous on your valuations or terms. Stick with the Silicon Valley VCs for blank checks. Let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù

Hey Biz-Buyers,

Welcome to this week‚Äôs Boring Business Brief, where we share some of the best insights, tips, and stories from our private biz-buying community.

Before we dive in‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a volatile market out there, and 2024 recessionary talk is unfortunately simmering. For those curious about securing their future by taking ownership through business acquisition (or just seeing how buying a cash-flowing biz works in the first place) ‚Äî next week, Codie is hosting a free, live Masterclass where she‚Äôll break it down.

If you want a taste of what our members are learning on their path to ownership, this is your chance. We have a cap on virtual attendees and over 1k are already signed up so secure your spot here (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VVVfNG27frfHW2J336620gtlVW2ZRfP155BfH-N6N1vZR3pyd0W95jsWP6lZ3m3W54RRbb66jMwPW7LHBG55F_N-3W7R8VHm2dXJzBW4Q3z-X3j7pblW8NWpGv1_KwyxW34xp4k4CTW3JV610zv4NtsLrW6xQX-M5Wz3wCN1PJp2wvcRZKW2QpqRb9lcczVW3_35hg74dF-dN7-ykyrJ5_L7W3zY54Q5gMtlCW463GtF9fsNpfW2XYKHY3lK6YgW2t1-Rs5ctsFjW2s6tCM81ffWGVNNp7c542475N3nlkhk8Fyd_W5QGqBh4kcYDHW2kVtkS6KnTdSW1qv0Nv12F6lTW5tSsSR8_WW_4W8KVwYR2d94K-W8VCRcG41zTNmVyh2lr9bJFczN3M5_6nMsttpW3B9ZK45m48WzW7pHFHm1rsPSLVfMZ_S5s9c7wdpVDRx04 ) .

1 cool thing: How to invest in our ‚Äúboring biz‚Äù VC fund

We talk a lot about owning and investing in small, boring biz‚Äôs. Heck, this is a newsletter about exactly that.

But the goal isn‚Äôt just to invest in the car washes, laundromats, and cleaning services of the world and educate others on how to do the same. We also want to invest in the startups making a real difference in this space, and we want to do it with some of you, too.

That‚Äôs why we launched a venture capital fund called Contrarian Thinking Capital (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VVVfNG27frfHW2J336620gtlVW2ZRfP155BfH-N6N1vYY3pyd0W7lCdLW6lZ3n8Vs6JW77kRwrZW7VntDh7bV8qMW4bxSQ43xzthSW8xjdTc151CNKN62s12zwDSllVJftfs8ZQRqBW2ypfZ16KHH5bW5lPW_R8QsxqwW5ksDvG6szF5HW1qKB6J44Y1_KW314WC360FQHmVKxQVy2Bj-L6N7GyzC59tvFzW3Gkr827fKw2HVDnJ3h7v08npW3-Js5v8bDF_QW71XX467T93qHN8vx8JSJQby3N3dxszbl7nBnW12VSNR2-3LnqW9d6N9Q4YKsPvW59LZWq4CXPS8VcsdJJ3zKgw6W58jmlt1n5Sb6f80qRY-04 ) last year.

In the weeds: How one member is doing due diligence on car washes

Recently, one member hadn‚Äôt even been looking to acquire car washes.

But the industry has kept coming back to ‚Äòem and they‚Äôve grown more curious, so they began asking some top-notch questions in the community, and we think it‚Äôs safe to say the itch was successfully scratched‚Ä¶

Question 1:

Here‚Äôs what one member had to offer:

- ‚ÄúFor saturation, it depends on what you are including in that bucket. Most self-service sites were built in the 1980s and 1990s with fewer and fewer being built in the early 2000s and so there should be legacy separation of at least a couple of miles between sites.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúThe advent of express tunnels changed the game but there is a pretty clear line in the sand of people who only use self-service/touchless, people who only go to expresses, and then floaters that are in between.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúAnother indicator would be pricing pressure. Simply put are prices going up or down? Down would signal price competition which is indicative of saturation but this is mostly a concern on the express side as that is where 99% of the new construction is focused right now.‚Äù

Question 2:

From the same community member as above:

- ‚ÄúI have a semi-controversial opinion that carwashes w/ real estate are more closely related to either self-storage or multi-family for valuations, which is where the cap rate (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VVVfNG27frfHW2J336620gtlVW2ZRfP155BfH-N6N1vZx3pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3mGW2hHsL527dxFtW316-Mt90CbZWW1ftJSk6CwnJdW3WJ9cB8VMYyPVzGbbs4XFbVsW1mZ26g78TlTVN21NL88mLhVTVxB0zh40s-3FW60pBP94Kc3tyN7Jb1bHYHRW_W72jv--4XTDDqN707pC3FJCjdW1tqrWh4vmBgdW914XQV8HZH6MW3-jpND7hzZHsW6RM0Cn7hDKMMW1Z6mc85CPZNWW8q0DcM5HsmqRW2k0xp9659DCmW6CjKnf1WRyvcW2KH4zb4FDjyZW6nCqwy73fTQyW5sg4Y17Wq9dSW6JxCNg892wvRVF8Csy3NFH0LW2F3R4v3wlmKnW42Q_s484zClRV65-K45g02Dpf3dX0Ms04 ) comes into play‚Ä¶‚Äù

- ‚ÄúThat being said, it‚Äôs also important to separately arrive at a blue-sky value for the business and real estate. And you can do that a few different ways using EBITDA (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VVVfNG27frfHW2J336620gtlVW2ZRfP155BfH-N6N1vZd3pyd0W7Y8-PT6lZ3n0W7flCkj2x_FPYW3rDfyT4QCsPQW2stsTr9ltMtYV6ksN03Mv_hwN9kLwC-PxwSxVg1rRq3dRD5PN941cTs3hN1QW66Kt8y5pmWGWW4h64Gn4Dr4KHW6WxlKB221wFQW2lC-Sv4C199gW82FRdm8Gv7MXW2l1rTt7RvY7yW10JKs95-fc9yW8xf5MH2stGWwVR8DsP7hxjxkW3NDyFX75TrJtW7tpBhD3f8VnyW7nShdQ3DdTWDW3CfG1F79QCJKW2sVdVs149PQYN3rj-KgZG6csTNGGx2g3RxtW8cbkmg1dR0MTW8f3njF8bR6TXW7R_Tvr8ycpYrf55H_d-04 ) multiples for the business and cap rates/comps for the real estate.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIt is somewhat possible to achieve more of a passive operation on the physical maintenance of the site, but you should expect to pay a premium for experienced technicians to come in and fix whatever has issues (pumps, switches, HP lines, bill validators, etc).‚Äù

... And this, from a facilitator:

- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not uncommon to use a cap rate to value a single-use business/RE like a car wash. We probably see more value in using a cap rate than otherwise. Then the question is what‚Äôs a reasonable cap rate, and whether they have done a thorough job of calculating the income?‚Äù

What‚Äôs the deal with showing brokers proof of funds?

Hey, it makes sense. Brokers and sellers don‚Äôt wanna spend time dealing with buyers who aren‚Äôt able to‚Ä¶ buy.

But is it really necessary for buyers to be asked to show proof of funds (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/VVVfNG27frfHW2J336620gtlVW2ZRfP155BfH-N6N1vZd3pyd0W7Y8-PT6lZ3kJW1XpFLs3GtBzXN5cbWKrVvVk0W2v1-q32prHfKW77GXvQ8gvKnwN5z9y7bkXcl1W4bm-4x6xVYGgW1L0fDK1vQmdMW5BmtMV1X96BJW2FpvJk5Cbn5wVpHlNV4R1qNCW440_fW4t7tFNVY6Srp2W5ymnVjtjhD8n1lBGW806Wh049bpGRW12rXxl8-rDqhW5Z89504xQxYVW266ptp4d9pFcW2RFtgV5BskyFW4LmwJc7PDPjqW92PJb18MWdT7W8sNXpR6cGdGpW8Jf3J-1d8bk4W7jRhrt5Yt-kFW6Ckyyy2XwJYKW6R9shs3LpXpfVwdBFS7Qy3kZdDmlW004 ) before having a convo with a seller or accepting an LOI? One of our members was curious about this‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs what one of our community facilitators (a biz broker themselves) had to say:

- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not uncommon to ask for proof of funds and those proof of funds could likely just be enough to cover a 10-20% cash deposit if the business will likely be SBA funded.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going down an SBA route, consider including your credit score as well to show that you should be able to qualify for a loan at least based upon that aspect. Another option is to get SBA pre-approved as that pre-approval will require you to show you‚Äôve got the cash for the required down payment. But again, this isn‚Äôt uncommon.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve also seen situations where the buyer‚Äôs CPA produced a letter stating that they had the required down payment in liquid capital.‚Äù

And here‚Äôs another member‚Äôs two cents (but worth a lot more than two cents): ‚ÄúI‚Äôve avoided the proof of funds required 90% of the time by confidently stating my ability to fund or my plan to obtain funds in the initial conversation.‚Äù

The Network State (and what it has to do with you & me...)

Hey Contrarians,

If you know me, aside from the words ‚Äúblue‚Äù and ‚Äúcollar,‚Äù the rest of the next sentence will come straight out of left field.

I recently spoke to 1,000 crypto technologists at an event in Amsterdam about blue-collaring the ‚Äúnetwork state.‚Äù Today we‚Äôll get into WTF that means, why it‚Äôs a lot more relevant than you might expect, and what I learned while there. You‚Äôll leave here with a lot to chew on.

Before we dive in‚Ä¶

Blue-collaring the network state, explained

A network state (https://d2RjD304.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2RjD304/MWmMhD-QK0TW7GM2lD8BvKHrW1KLHGL55GYqTN5QLhT63pyd0W7lCdLW6lZ3mxW5JMtpZ8tsS7CW1DKbnV6VSwQKW3d9g2v5PgTwnW1VrDCV2m5lRcW95Ty5z69j9-WW1DkW265cQXZJMg3MLkF7J0FW5r6GC564p0VYN2cWRX-Vm6HzW6zYGb-2973CGW24kmb57y_nYZW1PGR6C2NqJs3W8bCrXM7f0JDjMNcnhRzrqy_W5qZ6qP4qCtTBW2_lfwX1dr1jnN4Cl3znnPxPYW53SX8k5kY4YwW2lJRdx7j4bbJW7j57Mk5YHnjKW2vWk0b7B0mBfW82hh0Q6M3-lWW9fSgRX5cw0BGVwXSrl1FSDBjf2BhW5v04 ) has been defined as, ‚ÄúA country you can start from your computer, a state that recruits like a startup, a nation built from the internet rather than disrupted by it.‚Äù

American entrepreneur and investor Balaji Srinivasan wrote a book about the idea, and his conference, which I spoke at, centered on the topic. (Srinivasan was the former CTO of Coinbase and a former general partner at Andreesen Horowitz, too.)

Okay, but why did he invite Codie ‚ÄúBoring Business‚Äù Sanchez, best known for investing in laundromats and car washes (that are mostly run by 65-year-olds who probably think ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù is a Dan Brown book)‚Ä¶ to speak at a conference about global technological decentralization?

How do small business ownership or blue-collar work have anything to do with decentralization and open-sourcing?

It may be surprising, but they have a lot in common‚Ä¶

I spent 15 years in investment banking, asset management, and private equity. Finance is an industry heavily centralized on Wall Street, which I was told was where the best go to work for others to make more money than everyone else.

But as it turns out, that‚Äôs not always right. There‚Äôs a clear asymmetric upside potential to business ownership.

Even so, over time I‚Äôve realized ‚Äúacquisitions‚Äù have not really been open-sourced at all. You get an expensive degree, work your way up the ranks, and keep secret the lessons you learn, lining your pockets the whole time. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúspreading the wealth‚Äù in the form of knowledge.

‚ÄúWhat we do here is get rich quietly,‚Äù a private equity CEO once told me.

That didn‚Äôt sit right with me, and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so public about my work now.

My hope is as more humans learn acquisitions, we decentralize business ownership. We cut out the big guys altogether. We become the bank (seller financing), the brokers (referrals), and the PE firms (buyers).

So this brings me back to the network state event. If we‚Äôre going to achieve a decentralized world, we‚Äôll need big brains. But we‚Äôll need more than that. We‚Äôll also the business owners, the operators, their dirty fingernails, and their calloused hands.

For the technologists and futurists at this conference, it‚Äôs how they get the blue-collar world on board that‚Äôs the challenge‚Ä¶

To own, we need to simplify‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm a capitalist, to the max. It‚Äôs exactly why I believe so strongly in simplifying acquisitions for the many.

At its core, our movement is built around decoding the language of business buying for everyday people, and I think if the network state community wants to succeed, they‚Äôll need to simplify their language, too.

The folks at this conference get some hate for their unusual ideas and sometimes complex visions for the future. I can relate. But what if the people who are actually most open to their unusual ideas today, the people who are the most aligned with their beliefs about ownership, are the same people being left behind by them because the ideas are simply out of reach?

I‚Äôm talking, of course, about small business owners and the blue-collar world.

Take, for example, my small-business-owning parents. They‚Äôre your prototypical 65-year-olds who play on Main Street.

I ran a little experiment with them to prove this point.

I had them scroll through a bunch of Twitter accounts related to ‚Äúnetwork states‚Äù and had them write down all the words they didn‚Äôt understand. There were many.

Honestly, I think they‚Äôd probably find a lot of ideas in this space interesting, and maybe even relatable or useful. But I think their brains exploded seeing some of this stuff‚Ä¶

Broadly speaking, where‚Äôs the effort to communicate these ideas to the electricians and plumbers of the world who don‚Äôt even understand Twitter bios? Or the small business owners who probably value decentralized ownership more than anyone?

You can‚Äôt build a ‚Äústate‚Äù without these people, without the blue-collar world. The network state winners will be the ones who communicate their vision and value in simple terms to those who do the real-world building.

We use a saying in our investment team: ""Do you want to look smart, or do you want to win?""

If you‚Äôre really smart, you know that the most intelligent people actually speak the simplest and the clearest, not with the most complexity.

This will be vital to the network state movement. When people don‚Äôt understand something, they by and large are fearful of it. To get buy-in on new ideas, you have to explain them clearly.

Our biz-buying community at Contrarian Thinking is designed to simplify acquisition. We have a lot of work to do, but over the last 3 years, I think we‚Äôve made good progress. We get 100M+ views a month talking about small business buying. Through our educational programs, we‚Äôve tracked at least $120M in revenue bought by new business owners.

Whether it‚Äôs accelerating small business ownership or a decentralized future, you win by keeping things simple.

10 lessons about networking, communities, speaking, and our future

Just being AT this conference was an incredible experience. I‚Äôll leave you with my top 10 takeaways here‚Ä¶

- Your network will either shrink or expand your thinking. In some rooms, you can get away with thinking small. If you feel stuck, find a new room. Take care not to stay confined too long, atrophy starts fast.

- Short, simple talks create better ideas. The entire conference demanded 5-10 minute speeches from 40 speakers. The ideas were better without all the fluff and credentialing. Show, don‚Äôt tell.

- The next generation is SMART. I used to be frustrated with my parents for not understanding their phones. Then I began hearing about Kardashev scales, computational breakthroughs, & how to operate a 21st virus filter. Humbling. We‚Äôll be tech-obsolete faster than our parents.

- Intelligence does not care about logos. The smartest people you meet (often the richest) do not wear it on their sleeve. Confidence and intelligence wear better. Intelligent people judge based on content, not wrappers.

- Free thinkers are rare but easy to spot. Very few people come up with truly novel ideas that make you pause. How you can notice them: They‚Äôre willing to bat ideas around, and they argue not to ‚Äúwin,‚Äù but to find what is right. Unbounded curiosity... Aspire to this.

- Every movement starts with insider language. To create a new vision of the world, you need to define it. I analyzed a group of e/acc accounts and found ~75 words I couldn‚Äôt define. This shared language allows them to redefine the ways we think about the world.

- Divergent thinking stimulates new ideas. The Network State‚Äôs rapid-fire, disparate talks stimulated new ideas & solutions that a typical linear conference may not have.

- The future is here but unevenly distributed. After 1 Network State event, you can see: Charter cities already in effect, parallel establishments across sectors, and open-sourced AI & tech from those who think lifespans will eventually be endless.

- Pull the string on government overreach and it‚Äôll scare the hell out of you. I spoke to a crypto trader, a VR city simulator, a techno journalist, an AI open-source coder, and a charter city founder. The common thread? Governments do not like when strings that bind you to them are cut.

- Countries may look different in 20 years. I‚Äôm a very proud American. But I wonder if that phrase will change for the next generation. Five of ten people I met had 2+ passports. One company discussed passport benefit stacking. No one opened with ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù

So not boring...

As a reminder, here's what you‚Äôll learn:

‚úîÔ∏è WHY TRUE WEALTH LIES IN BUYING BORING BUSINESSES

Learn why I'm so passionate about buying boring businesses as a path
to financial independence and bigger profits down the road. Learn how
taking this path (as opposed to traditional investment paths) has
allowed me to build an empire that sets me free and keeps on giving.

‚úîÔ∏è THE BIG LIES WE WERE TOLD ABOUT WEALTH

Discover the shocking truths about wealth and how to break free from
the beliefs that are holding you back from achieving financial
success. Learn the truth behind creating wealth and the strategies to
break free from the cycle of financial struggle.

‚úîÔ∏è THE TOP MISTAKES MOST BIZ OWNERS MAKE

With startup failure rates as high as 90%, most new business owners
struggle to safeguard themselves against failure. Discover the most
common mistakes new business owners make and how you can steer clear
of them.

‚úîÔ∏è WHY NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO BUY A BUSINESS

Inflation can be a daunting challenge, but it can also be your gateway
to financial success. You just have to know how to use it. Learn how
to use it to your advantage and increase your investment income
streams using the BRRT and SOWS methods.¬†

‚úîÔ∏è HOW TO ESCAPE THE TIME-FOR-MONEY TRAP

Discover how to become a business owner with less risk than starting
from scratch, and embrace a fulfilling career on your terms. Say
goodbye to feeling trapped and hello to taking control of the quality
of your work, your work schedule, your colleagues, and even your
vacation time.

‚úîÔ∏è HOW TO USE OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY (OPM) TO BUY A BUSINESS

Why risk all your hard-earned cash on a business venture when you can
use Other People's Money (OPM)? Learn how to buy a business with as
little risk as possible and use your own money for additional
investments. It's time to invest smart and make your money work for
you.

‚úîÔ∏è HOW TO FIND THE BEST OFF-MARKET DEALS AND AVOID THE BAD ONES

Don't waste your time and money on bad deals. Discover how to find the
most lucrative off-market deals. Learn how and where to identify the
best business opportunities in today's market. Become a deal-making
pro and watch your investment portfolio grow.

‚úîÔ∏è¬†30 MINUTES Q&A WITH ME

PLUS, stick around for the Q&A and ask me any questions you have about
business buying or deal-making.¬†

See you tomorrow!

10 Steps to Buying a Business that Cashflows 

Hey¬†Max,

I‚Äôm so excited.¬†

Not just because we are KICKING OFF OUR LIVE MASTERCLASS IN A FEW
HOURS [https://event.webinarjam.com/go/live/47/r2l53av1iqs6sl]‚Ä¶

Or¬†because thousands of you have registered to this Masterclass,
giving purpose to what I do.

But because I get to talk about the 1 thing that I know can MAKE MORE
NEW FINANCIALLY FREE HUMANS THAN ANYTHING ELSE (including real estate,
AirBnB arbitrage, crypto or hoarding cash in your 401k).¬†

THAT 1 THING IS BUYING YOUR FIRST ‚ÄúBORING BUSINESS.‚Äù¬†

But why listen to one ‚Äì who am I anyway?¬†

Hi, I'm Codie!

[FhpvHA5SrotiVsig45LQ1694774371.png]

I‚Äôm a business acquisition and deal making expert who wants to HELP
PEOPLE LIKE YOU BECOME FINANCIALLY FREE‚Äìregardless if that means
creating a new investment income stream, or making millions.

I started what I‚Äôm doing because I realized that WEALTH IS CREATED
THROUGH OWNERSHIP, but last I checked schools are still teaching kids
how to work for the man, and not become THE man (or woman).

I‚Äôm a reformed journalist, turned institutional Wall Streeter, to
investor and advisor, to becoming the Founder and CEO at Contrarian
Thinking.

I now own multiple¬†businesses (but without having to actually work IN
any of them‚Äìexcept this one).

Truth is, BUYING A PROFITABLE BUSINESS IS ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE WILLING
TO WORK AT IT AND IT‚ÄôS PROBABLY WAY EASIER THAN YOU THINK.

AND I‚ÄôLL SHOW YOU HOW IN JUST A FEW HOURS.¬†

Make sure YOU'VE SET ASIDE THE TIME ON YOUR CALENDAR
[https://www.addevent.com/event/xy19191897], have your notepad ready,
and are ready to take action towards financial independence.

WE'LL MEET ON THIS LINK.

Codie Sanchez <info@contrarianthink.com>,pocheezi567@gmail.com,Exclusive 72hr Masterclass access!,"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 15:10:41 -0600","Wow ‚Äî that was BY FAR the most successful masterclasses I've ever hosted!

3,833 Contrarians showed up live to hear me talk about business buying and how to become a badass dealmaker.

Investing in yourself, your family, your community, and your future‚Äîand ditching your 9-5‚Äîare popular topics. Go figure.

3,833 Contrarians learned:

- The best time to start is yesterday. After teaching thousands of Contrarians, I can tell you one thing the most successful people have in common: Speed. Take action now.
- Take advantage of a down market to acquire high-upside income-producing assets ‚Äî often for much less (or nothing at all) than you‚Äôd typically put down on a home or office building. Making an investment that doubles or triples your current income is rare in real estate, but members of our Contrarian Community are doing it right now with small, boring businesses.
- 2.5+ MILLION small businesses are up for sale. And thousands more go up daily as Boomers retire. The potential for success is huge RIGHT NOW. Millions of business owners want to sell their companies to you. And they want to do it yesterday.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. We covered so much more.

Still on the fence?

Wondering what everyone else is so excited about?

Here is a sneak peek at EVERYTHING that awaits you inside our exclusive community:

‚Äì Exclusive Private Community

This is where the magic happens. We've had members do deals together, become best friends, and use us for expert guidance and accountability. Members range from experts in tech, landscaping, real estate, laundromats, hotels, bakeries, professional service firms, and much more.

We‚Äôre all here for one reason: Getting it done and sharing our collective wisdom.

But don't just take my word for it. Nailea, one of our members, shares firsthand how being part of this exclusive community has helped her grow:

‚Äì Weekly Live Calls

Every Monday night, we review your potential deals, hear about businesses members just closed on along with their key lessons, and invite other top dealmakers to come and speak with us. We also host various other monthly calls, bringing in additional industry experts, doing member deal reviews, and more.

‚Äì All Access Course

Our course includes everything you need to go from ""I don't know how to buy a business"" to ""I'm about to close on my first deal"" in 30 days or less. You get full access to all our existing content and future updates for one year.

‚Äì 10 Additional Resources (you won‚Äôt find them anywhere else)

1. Personal Profit and Loss Sheet: This vital tool is custom-designed to help you assess a business's financial health. Track income, expenses, and net profit or loss at a glance, making it an essential companion for evaluating potential business deals.

2. Business Buying Calendar: This structured timeline guides you through every stage of the business buying process. From the initial interest to closing the deal, it ensures you meet crucial deadlines and stay organized throughout your acquisition journey.

3. Deal Clarity Worksheet: Keep all the details of potential deals in one place with this comprehensive worksheet. Document key aspects like business overview, financial performance, and growth opportunities, making it easier to compare and analyze various opportunities simultaneously.

4. Business Buying Checklist: Don't miss a beat with this all-inclusive checklist. Covering vital considerations such as evaluating financials and understanding customers, it acts as a safety net, making sure you've thought of everything before making a decision.

5. NDA Template: Protect sensitive information with our professional Non-Disclosure Agreement template. Essential during negotiations and due diligence, it ensures that confidential information about the business remains secure.

6. 3M Model Worksheet: Assess potential acquisitions with a focus on Market, Money, and Management. This tool forces you to gauge whether the market is large enough, if the business can generate sufficient cash flow, and if the management team has the skills to drive success.

7. LOI Template: The Letter of Intent template guides you in stating your intention to purchase a business. It outlines the non-binding terms and conditions of the deal, giving you the flexibility to back out if due diligence uncovers issues.

8. Due Diligence Checklist: Thoroughly vet potential businesses with our comprehensive Due Diligence Checklist. Covering financial, legal, operational, and market aspects, it helps you uncover potential red flags or hidden opportunities that may influence your decision.

9. Term Sheet: This essential template outlines the basic terms and conditions of your proposed business deal. It serves as the foundation for further negotiations and helps prevent misunderstandings and disputes down the line.

10. 13-Week Cashflow Template: This isn't just a spreadsheet; it's your business's financial pulse monitor. With this fundamental tool, you'll manage your new business's short-term financial health like a seasoned CFO.

Offering a week-by-week, quarter-based projection, it provides an immediate view of cash flow, allowing you to monitor, forecast, and respond to financial movements. No more financial surprises; you're in control.

These Contrarian Community resources are your fast track to success in the world of business acquisitions.

Skip the hours of work, the trial and error, the costly mistakes, and lessons learned the hard way. Get all the knowledge, support, and tools you need right at your fingertips, ready to guide you to success in buying those ""boring"" businesses that can turn into gold mines.

It took me YEARS to develop this knowledge, create these tools, and refine the systems and structures I'm offering in the Contrarian Community. I spent 80 hours a week battling burnout on Wall Street to learn these lessons.

But you won‚Äôt have to.

You can get up to speed in weeks, not years, without the bumps and bruises or heavy losses.
